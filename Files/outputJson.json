Ever try to visualize in four dimensions or six or seven? Linear algebra describes things in two dimensions, but many of the concepts can be extended into three, four or more. Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning.  Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn\u0027t a prereq) so don\u0027t confuse this with regular high school algebra."}

Integral calculus allows you to mathematically prove this crazy idea. When you think of calculus, think tiny as in infinitesimal. By subdividing the space between you and the wall into ever smaller divisions, you can mathematically establish that there is an infinite number of divisions, and you can never actually get to the wall. Do not try this at home kids, not without some help from integrals and derivatives, the basic tools of calculus. The study of integral calculus includes: integrals and their inverse, differentials, derivatives, anti-derivatives, and approximating the area of curvilinear regions."}

Interestingly, for ideal sparse signals with no measurement noise, random measurements allow perfect reconstruction while measurements based on principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA) do not. At the same time, for other signal and noise distributions, PCA and ICA can significantly outperform random projections in terms of enabling reconstruction from a small number of measurements. In this paper we ask: given a training set typical of the signals we wish to measure, what are the optimal set of linear projections for compressed sensing? We show that the optimal projections are in general not the principal components nor the independent components of the data, but rather a seemingly novel set of projections that capture what is still uncertain about the signal, given the training set. We also show that the projections onto the learned uncertain components may far outperform random projections. This is particularly true in the case of natural images, where random projections have vanishingly small signal to noise ratio as the number of pixels becomes large. Joint work with Hyun-Sung Chang and Bill Freeman.   I will give a brief introduction to questions of representation, learning and inference in probabilistic graphical models and illustrate these ideas in applications from our own work in computational biology and computer vision."}

We have explored a wide range  of networks inspired by generative models  from the literature, and a diverse set of collective  strategic problems, including biased voting,  graph coloring, consensus, and networked  trading. These experiments have yielded a  wealth of both specific findings and emerging  general themes about how populations of human  subjects interact in strategic networks.  Kearns will review these findings and themes,  with an emphasis on the many more questions  they raise than answer.  Michael Kearns is a professor of computer  and information science at the University of  Pennsylvania, where he holds the National Center  Chair in Resource Management and Technology.  He is the founding director of Penn Engineering’s  new Market and Social Systems Engineering  (MKSE) program. Kearns has  secondary appointments in the Statistics and  Op erations and Information Management  (OPIM) departments of the Wharton School,  and is an affiliated faculty member of Penn’s  Applied Math and Computational Science graduate  program. Kearns also serves as an advisor  to Yodle, kaChing, Invite Media, and Kwedit.  His research interests include topics in machine  learning, algorithmic game theory, social networks,  computational finance, and artificial intelligence.  Most recently, he has been conducting  human-subject experiments on strategic and  economic interaction in social networks. Kearns  received his B.S in mathematics and computer  science from the University of California at  Berkeley in 1985, and his Ph.D. in computer  science from Harvard University in 1989.

We describe the basic qualitative behavior of dynamical systems in the context of a simple population model. As time allows, we will then discuss other types of models such as chemical reactions inside the cell, or excitable systems leading to oscillations and neuronal signals.

It was designed by a visionary man who knew that programmable computers were coming and that, once they were built, they would be able to play chess. The man, of course, was Alan Turing, one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived. Soon after the war he wrote the instructions that would enable a machine to play chess. Since there was as yet no machine that could execute the instructions he did so himself, acting as a human CPU and requiring more than half an hour per move. A single game is recorded, one in which Turing\u0027s \\\"paper machine\\\" lost to a colleague.    Garry Kasparov will sketch the historical context of Turing’s involvement in chess and then go on to describe how the chess computer experts reconstructed the paper machine to run on a modern day computer. In the process they encountered a problem: the chess engine refused to duplicate all of Turing’s moves as recorded in the historical game. The debugging process, in which computer chess pioneer Ken Thompson was involved, left the programmers baffled. Then someone called Donald Michie, a colleague from Bletchley, who advocated debugging not the program but Turing! “Alan did not care about details; he was interested in general principle.” Kasparov’s lecture will discuss the points of deviation from the recorded game.    In the second part of the lecture Kasparov will describe a number of Turing Tests that have been performed for chess. For a while it was impossible to reliably tell computer games from those of humans. However, today the task has become simpler because of the ruthless precision of computer play, which has reached a level of many hundreds of Elo points above the best human players."}

Moderator David Fialkow would “love to tell you I’m wicked brilliant, analytical, clairvoyant, but I’m not.” As he sees it, a large part of business success depends on “the people you meet, and understanding how relationships lead to other things.” One member of Fialkow’s extensive yet intimate business network is Ben Fischman, who affirms this emphasis on relationships as he recounts his own journey through several enterprises.    As a Boston University junior, Fischman hungered to channel his energy into business, and with some friends, seized on the idea of a store selling truly comfortable baseball caps. The scheme earned venture capital funding, and rolled out over several years, five LIDS stores to hundreds of kiosks countrywide. During these initial years, Fischman gained the “most important wisdom: to surround myself with people who know a lot of stuff I don’t know.” Another lesson arrived with the hire of a CEO “who within six months, single-handedly destroyed the company’s culture” and led it to Chapter 11. Fischman now takes a more leisurely pace vetting candidates before hiring them.    New opportunities arose, leading to e-commerce ventures and his current company, Rue La La, a “viral” online business that “creates incredible addiction” in its customers.” Fischman modestly describes himself as “a one-trick pony,” capable of pulling together a team of great people “with thick skin, creativity and guts,” who can adjust when the business plan doesn’t unfold as written.    Another Fialkow colleague, Alex Laats, found his way into business in a roundabout way. An MIT math and physics major with a Harvard law degree, Laats ended up in MIT’s Technology Licensing Office, where he seized opportunities “to get close to technology and entrepreneurs.” By 1996, he was “getting antsy to start his own business.” He found venture capital for a business phone product that was ultimately acquired by 3Com. His next enterprise was “not a disaster but not a success,” raising $42 million in a single round of money-raising, in 1999. But the company “hadn’t solved its major problems yet,” and it was a time when the “business world ran into telecom breakdown.” Still, Laats gained from this experience: “It’s about not being successful. It’s important to know those lessons are often times more valuable than victory lessons.”    His most recent work involves a new division at famed R\u0026D services company BBN, creating products for the government, among others. It wasn’t the easiest fit at first, admits Laats: “I started with nothing, just me and two guys. They didn’t know what to do with me.” But he’s already got some major successes under his belt. There’s Boomerang, a counter sniper product used by American soldiers in Afghanistan, and another venture that brought in $75 million in revenue last year, profits that prove the viability of his business concept."}

Compared with other biochemical systems, the modelling of cell signalling systems faces additional difficulties related to the challenges quantifying protein-protein processes but also to the lack of complete information about the topology of the considered network interactions. Since in most of the metabolic systems the complete network of interactions is (virtually) perfectly established, in cell signalling systems the real structure of the pathways is an open question to be elucidated either in parallel or through mathematical modelling based analysis. In this talk we discuss the use of power-law models (advantages and challenges) in biochemical systems. We also show how pre-existent biological knowledge and quantitative data can be integrated through mathematical modelling to validate hypothesis about the structure of signalling pathways."}

We describe the basic qualitative behavior of dynamical systems in the context of a simple population model. As time allows, we will then discuss other types of models such as chemical reactions inside the cell, or excitable systems leading to oscillations and neuronal signals.

In these works, the authors use the framework of modules over non-commutative rings to formulate an analogous rank test for parameter identifiability of delay systems with known time-delays. Our ongoing work will then be motivated by a model of cellular signal transduction by Timmer et al. [3], where the sojourn time of STAT-5 in the nucleus is modelled by an unknown time delay which is estimated numerically by Timmer et al.. We will show how the identifiability of the time delay parameter is determined by the form of the external input-output representation of the system.

In this talk, I will describe a recently developed approach to this problem that inputs a few training points from a user (e.g., from mouse clicks) and produces a segmentation by computing the probabilities that a random walker leaving unlabeled pixels/voxels will first strike the training set. By exact mathematical equivalence with a problem from potential theory, these probabilities may be computed analytically and deterministically. The algorithm is developed on an arbitrary, weighted, graph/mesh in order to maximize the broadness of application. I will illustrate the use of this approach with examples from several segmentation problems (without modifying the algorithm or the single free parameter), compare this algorithm to other approaches and discuss the theoretical properties that describe its behavior.

We describe the basic qualitative behavior of dynamical systems in the context of a simple population model. As time allows, we will then discuss other types of models such as chemical reactions inside the cell, or excitable systems leading to oscillations and neuronal signals. The necessary linear algebra is also discussed to avoid including additional requirements for this course.Recorded on February 19, 2014Required attribution: Enciso, German A.

The hope of active learning is that interaction can substantially reduce the number of labels required, making solving problems via machine learning more practical. This hope is known to be valid in certain special cases, both empirically and theoretically.    Variants of active learning have been investigated over several decades and fields. The focus of this tutorial is on general techniques which are applicable to many problems. At a mathematical level, this corresponds to approaches with provable guarantees under weakest-possible assumptions since real problems are more likely to fit algorithms which work under weak assumptions.    We believe this tutorial should be of broad interest. People working on or using supervised learning are often confronted with the need for more labels, where active learning can help. Similarly, in reinforcement learning, generalizing while interacting in more complex ways is an active research topic. Please join us."}

To fill the void, basic researches of the programme group will manly concentrate on these issues, laying special emphasis on the time between the 17th and the 20th century. The focal point will be the Baroque period when, apart from the Gothic, art in our country was most prosperous. The art of the 17th and 18th centuries has contributed a particularly important share to Slovenian artistic identity, and the Baroque, as the last of the great European all-emcompassing styles, represented one of the firmest cultural bonds which tied Slovenia to other European countries. With regard to European integration processes, researches into Baroque art are among the priority tasks of Slovenian art history, since the unity of Europe is based on the difference between individual nations.    The investigation of Slovenian artistic identity, together with the placing of Slovenian artistic patrimony into European context, will be conducted simultaneously on several (regional and genre) levels, which is suited to the character of our heritage. At the focus of the research will be the art of Ljubljana and the so-called Ljubljana Baroque (architecture, sculpture, painting), and alongside with this the Ljubljana bishops and the ecclesiastical orders that left an essential imprint on the image of Slovenian capital will be studied. New scientific findings will be presented to a wider public on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the consecration of Ljubljana cathedral. Subjects of a detailed research will be some central personalities of Carniola, such as the sculptors surnamed Vrbnik, the architects surnamed Ma?ek, the painter Jelovšek, the polymath Johann Weichard Valvasor and his close connectedness with the artistic heritage of the 17th century and his zeal as an art collector. On the basis of a thorough study of the monuments in Carniola, Styria and the Littoral, it will be possible, on the one hand, to establish regional variants, investigate key monuments and significant artists and, on the other, to prepare an overall survey of art from the 17th to the 20th century on the Slovenian territory. The self-evident fact that Slovenian artistic past can no longer be studied in Slovenia alone, in isolation from the art of our European neioghbours, has not been sufficiently taken into account in \\\"practical\\\" research, although it is crucial in the establishing and recognizing of Slovenian identity. Therefore this will be the principal methodological approach of the researches. Because the knowledge about the formal characteristics of the monuments is not sufficient, but it is also necessary to comprehend and highlight their spiritual background and culturo-historical circumstances of their origin, an important share in the research work of the programme group will be the study of archival documents and literary sources and critical publication of sources for art history."}

At the same time, the accelerating pace of progress also highlights limitations in current approaches to modeling. One of these limitations is the insufficient degree to which the semantics and qualitative behaviour of models are systematised and expressed formally enough to support unambiguous interpretation by software systems. As a result, human intervention is required to interpret and connect a model\u0027s mathematical structures with information about the its meaning (semantics). Often, this critical information is usually communicated through free-text descriptions or non-standard annotations; however, free-text descriptions cannot easily be interpreted by current modeling tools.  We will describe three efforts to standardize the encoding of missing semantics for kinetic models. The overall approach involves connecting model elements to common, external sources of information that can be extended as existing knowledge is expanded and refined.

Standard reductions to black-box computational primitives do not usually meet real-world demands and have to be modified at all levels. The increasing complexity of ML problems requires layered approaches, where algorithms are components rather than stand-alone tools fitted individually with much human effort. In this modern context, predictable run-time and numerical stability behavior of algorithms become fundamental. Unfortunately, these aspects are widely ignored today by ML researchers, which limits the applicability of ML algorithms to complex problems.  Background and Objectives    Our workshop aims to address these shortcomings, by trying to distill a compromise between inadequate black-box reductions and highly involved complete numerical analysis. We will invite speakers with interest in *both* numerical methodology *and* real problems in applications close to machine learning. While numerical software packages of ML interest will be pointed out, our focus will rather be on how to best bridge the gaps between ML requirements and these computational libraries. A subordinate goal will be to address the role of parallel numerical computation in ML. Examples of machine learning founded on numerical methods include low level computer vision and image processing, non-Gaussian approximate inference, Gaussian filtering / smoothing, state space models, approximations to kernel methods, and many more.  Impact and Expected Outcome    We will call the community\u0027s attention to the increasingly critical issue of numerical considerations in algorithm design and implementation. A set of essential rules for how to use and modify numerical software in ML is required, for which we aim to lay the groundwork in this workshop. These efforts should lead to an awareness of the problems, as well as increased focus on efficient and stable ML implementations. We will encourage speakers to point out useful software packages, together with their caveats, asking them to focus on examples of ML interest. Raising awareness about the increasing importance of stability and predictable run-time behaviour of numerical machine learning algorithms and primitives. Establishing a code of conduct for how to best select and modify existing numerical mathematics code for machine learning problems. Learning about developments in current numerical mathematics, a major backbone of most machine learning methods."}

For us BeL is one of the most promising architecture offices in Germany of its generation; it is also one of the most unusual German offices we know. German Architecture is primarily obsessed with technology and functionality, it wants to be a 100 % reliable and eliminate all doubt. The success and tragedy of German Architecture is that often enough it also fulfils these goals. It is a success because it is not exactly bad to be in building that works; but if that’s all there is to a building, it is also kind of tragic. To overcome this germanic dialectics, BeL has built its practice upon the assumption that its possible to marry the rational and the surreal. They argue that if only you take the rational seriously enough, it will ultimately reveal a latent irrational counter side. Wilfully misreading the determinism of German Technophilia, they uncover a universe of almost mystic inexplainability. The logic of their actions is guided by a methodic double-bind:  When they go to bed with Neufert under their pillow, they are prone to wake up with Schwitters on their tongue. If they strive for mathematical monosemy, they are bound to end up in ambiguity. To make architecture in Germany with such a twisted mindset is tantamount to asking for trouble. And so for years past BeL had to walk the stony trail of endless competitions, hopeless clients and clueless critics. But good-spirited as their names suggests, BeL have been patient and enduring, knowing their time will come. Over a period of 10 years of ceaseless practice they have crafted a unique way of making architecture, one which today luckily materializes more and more in buildings, too, and one which ultimately might help German Architecture to discover the virtue of the doubt. In 2011 they have been awarded the Kunstpreis Baukunst by the German Acadamy of the Arts."}

However, there is a subset of problems which humans can prove by the use of geometric operations on diagrams, so called diagrammatic proofs. Insight is often more clearly perceived in these proofs than in the corresponding algebraic proofs; they capture an intuitive notion of truthfulness that humans find easy to see and understand.    We are investigating and automating such diagrammatic reasoning about mathematical theorems. Concrete, rather than general diagrams are used to prove particular concrete instances of the universally quantified theorem. The diagrammatic proof is captured by the use of geometric operations on the diagram. These operations are the \\\"inference steps\\\" of the proof. \\  An abstracted schematic proof of the universally quantified theorem is induced from these proof instances.    The constructive omega-rule provides the mathematical basis for this step from schematic proofs to theoremhood. In this way we avoid the difficulty of treating a general case in a diagram. One method of confirming that the abstraction of the schematic proof from the proof instances is sound is proving the correctness of schematic proofs in the meta-theory of diagrams.    These ideas have been implemented in the system, called DIAMOND, which is presented here."}

The execution of complex cognitive tasks can be modeled as a series of event driven transitions between mental states, each encoding a certain disposition to behavior or a specific sensori-motor decision. In this work, we hypothesize that these mental states are instantiated neuronally by recurrent circuit dynamics, in the form of stable attractors of the neural activity. We show that the mathematical conditions for the attractors and the event driven transitions can be satisfied only if neurons are selective to combinations of internal mental states and sensory stimuli. One possible way to generate such mixed selectivity is to introduce neurons whose afferent connections have random synaptic strengths. This approach has at least three highly desirable features. First, in spite of the combinatorial explosion of possible neurons with mixed selectivity, the number of needed randomly connected neurons grows only linearly with the number of relevant task events and contexts, which makes a reasonably sized network able to execute extremely complex cognitive tasks. Second, the firing patterns of neurons of the simulated proposed network, capture several aspects of the activity recorded in prefrontal cortex and other brain areas involved in a complex cognitive processes. The activity is self-sustaining in the absence of events, rule selective, and highly heterogeneous. Third, the introduction of randomly connected neurons accelerates the convergence of learning algorithms and it can be exploited to rapidly learn complex behavioral tasks. In conclusion we think that mixed selectivity, so widely observed in the living brain, can be an important and general functional principle for executing complex cognitive tasks.    "}

Activity 4 discusses the centre piece of computational algebraic methods of attack, the famed Simplex algorithm. This module focuses on the logic of the algorithm and the useful associated qualitative properties of duality, degeneracy, and efficiency. The final Activity touches on the problem of stability of obtained optimal solutions in relation to variations in specific input or output factors in the constraints and objective functions.

I will briefly review our work on developing a hierarchical feedforward architecture for object recognition based on the anatomy and the physiology of the primate visual cortex.

He first reminds his audience that such information is reducible to qubits, a two-state system that can exist in a superposition of states -- such as the polarized photon. Bennett believes that “quantum mechanics helps resolves the paradox or puzzle of the origin of the second law” of thermodynamics—the irreversible increase of entropy. Classical science might invoke chaos dynamics or environmental effects to explain entropy. The quantum way of viewing it involves entanglement.    In classical mechanics, when two subsystems in a definite state interact “by some deterministic reversible interaction,” there will be a definite output for each subsystem. “The entropy of the whole thing will be 0+0\u003d0.” But while the entropy output of two quantum systems interacting might be 0, the individual subsystems manage to have “as much entropy as they could possibly have.” This is due to entanglement, “a state of the whole system that cannot be described by attributing states to its parts. Two entangled photons can be said to be in a definite state of sameness even though neither has a polarization of its own.” Bennett acknowledges “this is an idea that’s hard to explain to many people,” although he believes that back in 1967, during the Summer of Love, many people “could understand this from an intuitive sense, if not mathematically.”    Bennett plays with the famous evanescence of quantum information, noting that the photons illuminating him fill up the room with “optical replicas of the shape of my nose.” But where do they go? He says, “If no record is made of which path a photon follows through an interferometer, or if a record is made but then unmade, the photons will have followed a superposition of both paths. Putting it in slightly theological terms, after the experiment is over, even God doesn’t remember which path it followed.”    Most classical information, such as “a pattern of snowflakes or grains of rice in last night’s dinner,” is impermanent, though occasionally frozen by a fossil-like process, Bennett says. It’s like a medallion he saw in a flea market: “In 1832, on this spot, nothing happened.” But even if information in our physical world is doomed to vanish, in spite of our digital-age efforts to duplicate everything, “the particular physics of our universe” viewed from the perspective of quantum dynamics, seems to “evolve in a complexity-increasing manner, under appropriate conditions,” concludes Bennett."}

In addition, there is a well-developed theory of sufficient conditions for a kernel to be useful for a given learning problem. However, while a kernel function can be thought of as just a pairwise similarity function that satisfies additional mathematical properties, this theory requires viewing kernels as implicit (and often difficult to characterize) maps into high-dimensional spaces. In this talk I will describe a more general theory that applies to more general similarity functions (not just legal kernels) and furthermore describes the usefulness of a given similarity function in terms of more intuitive, direct properties of the induced weighted graph. An interesting feature of the proposed framework is that it can also be applied to learning from purely unlabeled data, i.e., clustering. In particular, one can ask how much stronger the properties of a similarity function should be (in terms of its relation to the unknown desired clustering) so that it can be used to *cluster* well. Investigating this question leads to a number of interesting graph-theoretic properties, and their analysis in the inductive setting uses regularity-lemma type results of [FK99,AFKK03]. This work is joint with Maria-Florina Balcan and Santosh Vempala."}

Supervised learning, or learning from examples, refers to a process that builds on the base of available data of inputs xi and outputs yi, i\u003d1,...,m, a function that best represents the relation between the inputs x in X and the corresponding outputs y in Y. The goal is to find an estimator fz on the base of given data z :\u003d ((x1,y1),...,(xm,ym)) that approximates well the regression function fp defined on Z\u003dX x Y. We assume that (xi,yi), i\u003d1,...,m are independent and distributed according to p. There are several important ingredients in the mathematical formulation of this problem. We follow the way that has become standard in approximation theory and has been used in recent papers. In this approach we first choose a function class W (a hypothesis space H) to work with. After selecting a class W we have the following two ways to go. The first one is based on the idea of studying approximation of the L2(px) projection fW :\u003d (fp)W of fp onto W. Here, px is the marginal probability measure. This setting is known as the improper function learning problem or the projection learning problem. In this case we do not assume that the regression function fp comes from a specific (say, smoothness) class of functions. The second way is based on the assumption fp in W. This setting is known as the proper function learning problem. For instance, we may assume that fp has some smoothness. We will give some upper and lower estimates in both settings."}

Nowadays, there is broad consensus that the ability to think probabilistically is a fundamental component of scientific literacy. For example:      The concept of statistical significance (to be touched upon at the end of this course) is considered by the Financial Times as one of \u0026quot;The Ten Things Everyone Should Know About Science\u0026quot;.     A recent Scientific American article argues that statistical literacy is crucial in making health-related decisions.     Finally, an article in the New York Times identifies statistical data analysis as an upcoming profession, valuable everywhere, from Google and Netflix to the Office of Management and Budget.  The aim of this class is to introduce the relevant models, skills, and tools, by combining mathematics with conceptual understanding and intuition."}

Recent theoretical, technological, methodological and analytic developments have provided us with the opportunity to look a little closer at the workings of the intact and damaged brain. In this talk I will give an overview of recent attempts to measure brain activity related to Language processes. One important aspect of this endeavour is that it is truly multi-disciplinary, involving cooperation between linguists, psychologists, mathematicians, geneticists, physicists and others. This level of scientific integration is challenging. It requires flexibility and a willingness to reconceptualise problems and to recognize common interests, but it returns synergistic results. Current best practice in neuro-linguistic research not only uses the available methods, analytic approaches and technologies to reveal the neural architecture and processes underpinning language but also use language as a vehicle to probe and extend the limits of the methods, analytic approaches and technologies. I will try to survey this multi-disciplinary landscape by addressing three basic questions:        * where - what parts of the brain are associated with language use?      * when - what is the time course of language processing?      * how - what mechanisms support the processing of language?    and maybe even a little why.   ----  Znanstveni ve?er bo namenjen pregledu najnovejših poskusov merjenja možganske aktivnosti, povezane s procesiranjem jezika.

Obenem bo poskusil odgovoriti na tri osnovna vprašanja:        * kje – kateri deli možganov so povezani z rabo jezika?      * kdaj – kakšen je ?asovni potek jezikovnega procesiranja?      * kako – kateri mehanizmi podpirajo procesiranje jezika?

In a forum companion to the traveling exhibit DARFUR/DARFUR, the speakers provide big picture political context, as well as actual images from the field.    Note: This lecture contains descriptions and images of horrific war crimes which may be difficult for some to view.    While the conflict may no longer be “hot news,” the “genocidal years are continuing,” says Robert Rotberg. Three million Darfuris are languishing in refugee camps on the border with Chad and in their own country. The leader of this desert nation, President Omar al-Bashir, has been accused by the International Court of war crimes, yet militias under his direction, including the feared Janjaweed, continue to rain death down on villages and refugee camps. Neither the world’s condemnation, nor a multilateral force, has stopped the violence. China’s support of Sudan (with its rich oil fields) presents another obstacle to peace. Rotberg worries about the appointment by President Obama of a special envoy, J. Scott Gration, who “has made welcoming noises to Bashir…offering carrots without carrying a big stick.” A plan for peace, says Rotberg, should include a ban on overflights; dismantling of the Janjaweed and all the militias, and their repatriation into village life; a mechanism for power-sharing at all levels; compensation for genocide; and support for reconstruction.    Susannah Sirkin and her investigators from Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) are among those who have documented the Sudanese government’s atrocities against the people of Darfur. People have been bombed, strafed and burnt out of their villages. Says Sirkin, “The government of Sudan knew full well what would happen when hundreds of thousands of people were forced out of their homes, knew they wouldn’t make it to a place where they could receive the basic necessities of survival.”    In spite of harrowing conditions, including the regime’s persecution of aid workers, PHR has collected ample evidence of “the crime of mass rape as a weapon in this war,” a crime that goes on even at the refugee camps. The peaceful pre-war existence of women, tending animals, family and farming, is brutally shattered when militias massacre their families, and assault them sexually. PHR doctors describe their suffering as “unimaginable.” Sirkin recounts the tragic story of one 18-year-old, whose experiences stand for the thousands who endure comparable horrors.    The finale of the panel is a slideshow by photojournalist Marcus Bleasdale of his 12 trips to Darfur in the past six years. He captures the fear -- entire communities huddled under trees for fear of detection by government planes – and the aftermath of Janjaweed attacks. There are charred villages, bodies left to rot in the sun and people burned by white phosphorus, dumped by helicopter. At the camps, there are child soldiers with amputated limbs, starving mothers and babies, and long lines for the plastic bottles of water provided by aid agencies. Says Bleasdale, “These aren’t singular stories; they’re happening thousands of times, in every village.”"}

Due to their generality and elegance, many of such results have served as standard tools in a variety of areas, including statistical learning theory, probabilistic combinatorics, and the geometry of Banach spaces. To illustrate some of the basic ideas, we start by showing simple ways of bounding the variance of a general function of several independent random variables. We show how to use these inequalities on a few key quantities in statistical learning theory. In the past two decades several techniques have been introduced to improve such variance inequalities to exponential tail inequalities. We focus on a particularly elegant and effective method, the so-called \\\"entropy method\\\", based on logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and their modifications. Similar ideas appear in a variety of areas of mathematics, including discrete and Gaussian isoperimetric problems, and estimation of mixing times of Markov chains. We intend to shed some light to some of these connections. In particular, we mention some closely related results on influences of variables of Boolean functions, phase transitions, and threshold phenomena."}

He argues that the Peace had the potential to keep peace between Athens and Sparta due to the arbitration clause. In addition, he argues that during this time, Athens sends various diplomatic messages to the wider Greek world stating their intentions for peace, such as the Panhellenic venture to establish Thurii. However, this peace is seriously challenged when Corinth and Corcyra come into conflict over Epidamnus. At this point, Athens could make an alliance with Corcyra and run the risk of angering Sparta or allow Corinth to potentially take over Corcyra\u0027s navy and change the naval balance of power. Athens decides on a defensive alliance.  **Reading assignment**:  Pomeroy, Burstein, Donlan and Roberts. Ancient Greece. Oxford University Press: New York, 1999, pp. 246-286.

Proteins control and mediate the   majority of biological activities and interactions among proteins play a decisive role in   the dynamic modulation of cellular behavior. Protein-protein interactions are essential   constituents of all cells and interactome analysis is an important component in the quest   for a systems level understanding of life.  We explore interactome networks for yeast, human and plant at ever increasing   completeness and quality using both experimental and computational mapping and   analysis tools. Based on benchmarking and standardized reference sets we have   developed experimental approaches and mathematical models for the quantitative   evaluation of the completeness and quality of interactome maps. These models enable a   critical assessment of current maps and guide development of a roadmap towards   completion.  Recently mapping of the first binary interactome network for the reference plant   Arabidopsis thaliana was completed. Using tools of graph theory we identify biologically   relevant network communities from which a picture of the overall interactome network   organization starts to emerge. Combination of interaction and comparative genomics   data yielded insights into network evolution, and biological inspection resulted in many   hypotheses for unknown proteins and revealed unexpected connectivity between   previously studied components of phytohormone signaling pathways.  Using the network we explored how bacterial and fungal pathogens perturb their host’s   network. Pathogen effectors from evolutionary distant pathogens were found to   converge on network hubs, which appear “guarded” by resistance proteins, and which   we show to be functionally important for the host’s immune responses. Genetically, we   were able to validate \u003e90% of the Arabidopsis proteins targeted by both pathogens.   Together, we show how high-quality protein interactome network maps provide us with   tools for elucidating fundamental laws underlying biological systems."}

Kastner describes four areas “in order of increasing difficulty” the new president must address:    The president’s first move should be to increase the prestige of science in government, by giving the science advisor a more important role, listening carefully to career scientists in government agencies, and encouraging rather than punishing them for speaking out.    Second, Kastner advises expanding basic research on energy and environment. The U.S. imports $700 billion worth of oil per year, placing the nation “in jeopardy economically and politically,” says Kastner. Clean energy is likely to be a huge industry, and if the U.S. is to lead worldwide, it must begin to master a cluster of technologies that together pose our best chance of beating climate change.    We need a huge infusion of R\u0026D money in such thorny areas as: carbon sequestration (we don’t yet know if CO2 can be efficiently and safely injected into underground pore space); electrical storage, where we need a five-fold improvement in battery technology to produce an all-electric car that can run for 200 miles; solar energy, where current solar cells are made from materials that are too costly, and not yet efficient enough. While federal and private energy research has been declining, the International Energy Agency estimates the world will require $17 trillion dollars to stabilize CO2emissions between now and 2050.    The third order of business involves biology: Having teased apart the DNA molecule and mapped the genome, we now stand ready for a third revolution in life science, says Kastner. This will involve the convergence of biology with mathematics, physics and engineering. Says Kastner: “The gigantic amount of data being generated by rapid sequencing requires new approaches: biology needs theory for the first time, needs integrating ideas to explore information and come up with clarity.”    The final and perhaps toughest job involves stabilizing science funding. Over the past 20 years, math, physical science and engineering funding have remained flat. In the life sciences it doubled (partly due to 9/11), then declined. While “it’s wonderful to give more money to science,” rapid increases over short times have often been followed by sharp dips, creating major research disruptions. Plus, says Kastner, it’s unhealthy to fund one area and not the rest. “Different sciences reinforce each other and the scientific enterprise cannot do well if only one field is supported and the others are not.”"}

Compare to the most existing distance metric learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm exploits the sparsity nature underlying the intrinsic high dimensional feature space. This sparsity prior of learning distance metric serves to regularize the complexity of the distance model especially in the ``less example number $p$ and high dimension $d$\\\" setting. Theoretically, by analogy to the covariance estimation problem, we find the proposed distance learning algorithm has a consistent result at rate $mathcal Oleft(sqrt{left( {m^2 log d} right)/n}right)$ to the target distance matrix with at most $m$ nonzeros per row. Moreover, from the implementation perspective, this $ell_1$-penalized log-determinant formulation can be efficiently optimized in a block coordinate descent fashion which is much faster than the standard semi-definite programming which has been widely adopted in many other advanced distance learning algorithms. We compare this algorithm with other state-of-the-art ones on various datasets and competitive results are obtained."}

He constructs models of reinforcement learning involving the networked structures of the basal ganglia. His efforts are captured and expressed quantitatively as probabilities, regressions, and algorithms.    In this presentation, Doya covers basic concepts of reinforcement learning, then surveys the last decade of inquiry into the components of the basal ganglia circuit governing voluntary motion. Among the topics: action values, action candidates, and reward prediction involving the neurotransmitter dopamine; model-free versus model-based learning strategies; and the essential role of serotonin as modulator in the complex information loop.    Doya’s recent research is carried out via robots he calls “cyber rodents.” His dream as an undergraduate was to “build a robot that learns the variety of behaviors on its own.” That is, the computer, not the human engineer, teaches the robot to move. He accomplished this in designing a machine-creature exhibiting emotion-like attributes characterized as “depression,” “impulsivity,” “greed,” and “patience.”    Doya believes the “metaparameters” of reinforcement learning must be “tuned appropriately…Otherwise the performance of your learning is very, very poor.” The iterative process involves three terms -- the reward itself, the expected reward for a new state based on choice of action, and memory of the reward gained in the previous state. In the comparison, any differential greater than zero can be exploited for learning. The tradeoff: “No pain, no gain.”    As research advanced to increasing levels of structural specificity, Doya posited that “there seems to be spatial segregation in the function” of basal ganglia components. Specialization in aspects of reinforcement learning is now seen, for instance, in ventral versus dorsal areas of the striatum.    Differentiation is also found in the cortico-basal ganglia information network: not a simple closed loop, but parallel electrical pathways conducting distinct neural operations. Further, the neuromodulators each have their respective missions. Dopamine encodes the temporal difference error -- the reward learning signal. Acetylcholine affects learning rate through memory updates of actions and rewards. Noradrenaline controls width or randomness of exploration. Serotonin is implicated in “temporal discounting,” evaluating if a given action is worth the expected reward. Doya reminds us that clinically “it is well known that the serotonin function is impaired in the depression patient.”    The system of basal ganglia components and neuromodulators requires dynamic balancing. A delicate interplay determines outcomes for learning, actions, and affective states. Doya’s synthetic models are proxies for human behavior, and his computational framework describing the moving parts ultimately has therapeutic implications for psychiatric and neurological disorders."}

The main ones are that fluctuations are much lager than those predicted from the standard economic theory (gaussian fluctuations), the clustering of volatility and a substantial non stationarity of all properties. Many Agent Based Models have been proposed to explain these phenomena and several are indeed able to reproduce some of them. However, the situation is still problematic becaus these models are typically rather complicated with various ad hoc assumptions. This has prevented a systhematic study of these effects. We have tried therefore to define a workable Agent based Model [1], which contains the essential elements, but in a mathematically simple and well defined framework. In addition we have considered some new important elements like the nonstationarity of the process with respect to the number of agents and the question of the self-organization. Namely why all markets evolve spontaneously towards the situation corresponding to the SF, considering that in all models this is restricted to a very narrow range of parameters. The SF are shown to correspond to finite size effects (with respect to time and to the number of agents N) which, however, can be active at different time scales. This implies that strict universality cannot be expected in  describing these properties in terms of effecive critical exponents. The introduction of a threshold in the agents action (small price movements lead to no action) triggers the self-organization towards the intermittent  state corresponding to the SF. From these studies the herding phenomenon seems to be a crucial one beyond the standard theory as a triggering element of bubbles and crashs which develop spontaneously without a cause-effect relation. The model can also be used backwards to derive the strategies of the agents from the price time series. Other applications are under consideration like the problem of finite liquidity and the possibility that the reference fundamental price is subject to large fluctuations if one cnsiders that all markets are linked into a large network [2]."}

We show how supply and demand determine leverage as well as the interest rate, and how impatience and volatility play crucial roles in setting the interest rate and the leverage. Mathematically, the model helps us identify the three key elements of a crisis. First, scary bad news increases uncertainty. Second, leverage collapses. Lastly, the most optimistic people get crushed, so the new marginal buyers are far less sanguine about the economy. The result is that the drop in asset prices is amplified far beyond what any market participant would expect from the news alone. If we want to mitigate the fallout from a crisis, the place to begin is in controlling those three elements. If we want to prevent leverage cycle crashes, we must monitor leverage and regulate it, the same way we monitor and adjust interest rates."}

Finally, I suggest a new approach dubbed the “criterial framework,” which attempts to divide the work of social science into a series of tasks and attendant criteria. This framework, it is argued, offers an optimal level of methodological unity, allowing arguments to meet and discoveries to cumulate without unduly constricting the work of social science."}

Such non-genetic individuality has been observed in a wide range of biological processes, including differentiation and stress response(1). A striking example is the heterogeneous response of bacteria to antibiotics, whereby a small fraction of drug-sensitive bacteria can persist under extensive antibiotic treatments. Recently, a renewed interest in the persistence phenomenon has revealed that non-genetic heterogeneity might be one of the main reasons for the failure of antibiotic treatment in infections such as tuberculosis, where a single persistent bacterium can re-start an infection(2). Persistence is typically observed through the monitoring of the survival fraction of a bacterial population exposed to antibiotics. The initially rapid killing of the bacteria is followed by a significantly reduced killing rate which indicates the presence of a persistent sub-population. When cells grown from this persistent sub-population are subjected again to antibiotics, the same bi-phasic killing curve is obtained, suggesting that the persistent sub-population is not genetically different from the original population. We have previously shown that persistent bacteria enter a phenotypic state, identified by slow growth or dormancy, which protects them from the lethal action of antibiotics(3). Here we studied the effect of persistence on the interaction between Escherichia coli and phage lambda. We focused on two different variations of this well-studied predator-prey system: (a) a phage that is present in the genome of each bacterium and can cause bacterial death by a process called \\\"prophage induction\\\" and (b) a lytic phage that attacks bacteria from the outside, infects them and them kills them. The effect of the persistent phenotype was studied in those systems and the experimental results obtained were then implemented in a mathematical description of these interactions(4).  We used long-term time-lapse microscopy to follow the expression of GFP under the phage lytic promoter, as well as cellular fate, in single infected bacteria. We found that dormancy that protects bacteria under antibiotic treatments also protects them against prophage induction. A competition experiment run between a low persistence population and a high persistence one demonstrated a clear advantage to the latter. This suggests that persistence might have evolved under the evolutionary pressure of prophage stress. Intriguingly, we found that, while persistent bacteria are protected from prophage induction, they are not protected from lytic infection. Quantitative analysis of gene expression revealed that the expression of lytic genes is suppressed in persistent bacteria. However, when persistent bacteria switch to normal growth, the infecting phage resumes the process of gene expression, ultimately causing cell lysis.  Despite its mild effect on the short-term survival of the population, the delayed cell lysis of persistent bacteria needs to be taken in account. Using a mathematical model for this predator-prey interaction, we found that the bacteria\u0027s non-genetic individuality can significantly affect the population dynamics, and might be relevant for understanding the co-evolution of bacterial hosts and phages.

Most of them relie on complex mathematical and algorithmic concepts, making them hard to  adapt, re- implement or integrate with other methods. To address this problem, we introduce a  novel method based on a minimal statistical model for observing transcriptional regulatory  interactions in noisy expression data, which is conceptually simple, easy to implement and  integrate in any statistical software environment, and equally well performing as existing methods.\\  **Results:** We developed a method to infer regulatory interactions based on a model where  transcription factors (TFs) and their targets are both differentially expressed in a gene-specific,  critical sample contrast, as measured by repeated two-way t-tests. Benchmarking on standard E.  coli and yeast reference datasets showed that this method performs equally well as the best  existing methods. Analysis of the predicted interactions suggested that it works best to infer  context-specific TF-target interactions which only co-express locally. We confirmed this hypothesis  on a dataset of more than 1,000 normal human tissue samples, where we found that our method  predicts highly tissue-specific and functionally relevant interactions, whereas a global coexpression  method only associates general TFs to non-specific biological processes.\\  **Availability:** A software tool called TwixTrix is available from http://omics.frias.unifreiburg.  de/software.

The Dagara believe that every individual comes into this life with a specific destiny. Some explains that names can be what he describes as \\\"problematic\\\" when they describe the task of their bearer because it is a constant reminder to a child of their life\u0027s work. Malidoma, for example, means \\\"friend of the enemy/stranger.\\\" As this name suggests, Malidoma Patrice Some has befriended the enemy to his people, which has been colonizing Westerners who have intruded on the lives and lifestyles of the Dagara, since the early 1900\u0027s. Some has written Of Water and the Spirit, overcoming difficulties in devising accurate translations between the Dagara language and English, to provide a remarkable, first-hand look at the Dagara culture. He has written this book to bring greater understanding to the members of the West about his culture and, by doing so, has brought a greater understanding to members of the West about the West itself.    Malidoma was born in Bukino Faso in West Africa, in 1956. Kidnapped at age four by one of the Jesuit missionaries that was trying to create a native missionary \\\"force\\\" to assist in converting more African people, Malidoma attended a boarding school for fifteen years. Here he learned about what he calls \\\"the white man\u0027s reality,\\\" which consisted of history, geography, literature, anatomy, mathematics, and Christianity.    When Malidoma was twenty years old, he escaped from the boarding school to return to his people. However, he soon discovered he no longer speak the same language as his people, since he had not been allowed to use that language in fifteen years. Some could not speak to his family until he relearned what he had forgotten and they could not fully understand each other until he unlearned what he had been taught. In order to relearn the reality of his people and be accepted by them, he had to undergo a month-long Dagara initiation process.    At 22, Malidoma was asked, by his elders, to relay the Dagara culture to the West in order to bring a greater understanding and acceptance of it. This was a difficult task for him for a number of reasons. He did not know how to describe his culture to a culture that does not accept much of what is central to their beliefs. He was unsure how his story would be accepted, to say the least. Malidoma holds three master\u0027s degrees and two doctorates from the Sorbonne and Brandeis University, and has taught at the University of Michigan.    Malidoma Patrice Some now sees his position as a two-way passage of information. He seeks to bring greater understanding through his work."}

This seminar examines scientific articles, participants’ memoirs, and works by historians, sociologists, and anthropologists of science to provide multiple perspectives on the use of computers in diverse fields of physical, biological, and social sciences and the humanities. We explore how the computer transformed scientific practice, and how the culture of computing was influenced, in turn, by scientific applications."}

This online publication is a reproduction the original lecture notes for the course \\\"Applied Geometric Algebra\\\" taught by Professor Tisza in the Spring of 1976. Over the last 100 years, the mathematical tools employed by physicists have expanded considerably, from differential calculus, vector algebra and geometry, to advanced linear algebra, tensors, Hilbert space, spinors, Group theory and many others. These sophisticated tools provide powerful machinery for describing the physical world, however, their physical interpretation is often not intuitive. These course notes represent Prof. Tisza\u0027s attempt at bringing conceptual clarity and unity to the application and interpretation of these advanced mathematical tools. In particular, there is an emphasis on the unifying role that Group theory plays in classical, relativistic, and quantum physics. Prof. Tisza revisits many elementary problems with an advanced treatment in order to help develop the geometrical intuition for the algebraic machinery that may carry over to more advanced problems. The lecture notes came to MIT OpenCourseWare by way of Samuel Gasster, \u002777 (Course 18), who had taken the course and kept a copy of the lecture notes for his own reference. He dedicated dozens of hours of his own time to convert the typewritten notes into LaTeX files and then publication-ready PDFs.

The process is thus necessarily incremental and relies on clearly defined objectives to succeed in improving the efficiency of ICT use in education. This document presents major themes to assist educators in better integrating ICT with their teaching, and particularly allowing them to offer higher quality distance education programs to Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics students.

Cuando trabajamos con superficies de R3, o en general con subvariedades del espacio euclídeo Rn, estamos disfrutando de la ventaja de la simplicidad conceptual; en general, estamos más cómodos tratando con subespacios de Rn  que con espacios métricos o topológicos arbitrarios. Sin embargo, esta aproximación a las variedades diferenciables tiene la desventaja de que importantes ideas están algunas veces ocultas por el familiar ambiente de Rn. Por esta razón, y tras haber motivado las variedades diferenciables con las superficies k-dimensionales de Rn, nos introduciremos en el estudio general de este concepto. La idea fundamental consiste en eliminar la dependencia del espacio euclídeo ambiente.  El aspecto global de la Geometría Diferencial tiene su origen en el mismo punto de partida de la Topología Algebraica con H. Poincaré (1854-1912), y su desarrollo inicial está estrechamente ligado a la figura de E. Cartan (1869-1951), quien al poner en escena la teoría general de conexiones (método de la referencia móvil) coloca el carácter global de la Geometría Diferencial en su punto álgido, restando al aspecto local el protagonismo propio de la época, y estableciendo las diferencias de ambos aspectos, global y local, que aún admitiendo estudios por separado, de las interrelaciones entre ambos se extrae la gran riqueza de resultados propios de la Geometría Diferencial.  Fue este interés por el estudio de las propiedades globales sobre una variedad lo que obligó a puntualizar adecuadamente las definiciones básicas. El primer intento serio fue el libro de O. Veblen (1880-1960) y J.H.C. Whitehead (1904-1960) titulado Foundations of Differential Geometry (1932), cuya idea esencial era la de definir rigurosamente las relaciones entre la variedad y los sistemas de coordenadas que se introducen en ella para su estudio, haciendo una clara distinción entre ambos conceptos. Se formula por primera vez, de manera explícita, que las variedades que estudia la Geometría Diferencial son un conjunto de dos elementos: primero, la variedad como conjunto de puntos, para cuya definición y tratamiento la Topología suministra los útiles y los medios necesarios; y segundo, un cierto conjunto de sistemas de coordenadas admisibles que permiten el estudio diferencial de la variedad y entre los cuales deberán existir ciertas fórmulas de transformación, o ciertas relaciones de equivalencia, que los vinculen entre sí y permitan pasar de unos sistemas a otros.  Esta idea se fue puliendo y simplificando hasta llegar a la definición actual de variedad diferenciable, la cual es el resultado de sucesivos perfeccionamientos debidos principalmente a H. Whitney (Differentiable manifolds, Ann. of Math., 37 (1936), 645-480), C. Chevalley (Theory of Lie groups, Princeton, 1946), S.S. Chern (Topics in differential geometry, Princeton, 1951) y G. De Rham (Variétés différentiables, Hermann, Paris, 1955). A partir de mediados de los años 50 la definición de variedad diferenciable es ya usual en todos los textos de Geometría Diferencial."}

The usual modeling approach, based on chemical kinetics, is hampered by the large number of assumptions needed. As an alternative, we propose a spin-flip dynamics defined by asymmetric mean-field interactions. This dynamics yield density-profile processes whose trajectories converge almost surely to the solutions of dynamical systems with possibly complex behavior."}

Joseph Smith notes that the teaching approach “depends on the application,” and applications are both theoretical and practical. Students must first ask what is entropy, and why is it needed, says Smith. He focuses on “idealizations that often get ignored,” such as isolation, equilibrium and system boundaries. “If we don’t get those straight in the beginning student’s mind, then there’s a lot of confusion.”    To Howard Butler’s way of thinking, “teaching the Second Law is much more difficult and challenging a task than teaching Newton’s Second Law of Motion,” both because the concepts involved are so much more complex and abstract, and because the Second Law takes on very different forms depending on which thermodynamic domain is being considered.”    Andrew Foley “tries not to worry too much about what entropy is.” Instead, he handles the whole concept as if it were an accounting problem: “money being moved through a mint.” We can “shove the property of energy instead of money, and produce a form of accounting for energy equations.” Says Foley, “First Law, Second Law -- it’s all accounting.”    As engineering and biology converge, “it’s important that students understand the thermodynamics of biological molecules,” says Kim Hamad- Schifferli. She demonstrates the Boltzmann distribution with such biological examples as the coiling of DNA from its double-stranded to single-stranded form. Hamad- Schifferli acknowledges that entropy is very difficult for students to grasp viscerally, and that “one thing that helps greatly is the lattice model -- the entropy of mixing two gases, for example.”    Bernhardt Trout also invokes Boltzmann, “who believed in atoms vehemently, without substantive proof.” This is because “he didn’t want to believe in the soul, he wanted to believe we are nothing but matter and motion.” Trout says that while we can get a more accurate, mathematical description of atoms, “we owe it to our students to teach them about these most fundamental issues to try to reengage the original questions in the original context in which they existed.”    Jeffery Lewins reminisces about being “Keenanized” during his college years. He notes that “in the great book, Professor Keenan uses the energy-entropy volume space quite late to discuss equilibrium.” Lewins suggests that more can be made of this space in teaching.    Enzo Zanchini discusses “a rigorous definition of entropy valid also for nonequilibrium states.” He considers closed systems, and lays out a thorough set of basic definitions, going over the First Law and energy, and the Second Law and entropy.    “There are so many textbooks on thermodynamics, so many schools of thought, says Michael von Spakovsky because “there is not a whole lot of agreement on a lot of things.” He recounts how a unified theory developed at MIT helped resolve key issues in thermodynamics, by proposing “a broader, self-consistent quantum kinematics and dynamics. … Entropy becomes an intrinsic property of matter, including single particles.”"}

While all animals don’t enjoy the same rewards, Paul Glimcher has discovered some common features in the way animal brains learn to recognize and pursue something of value.    Glimcher is one of the founding fathers of the young field of neuroeconomics, in which economic theories help inform investigations of brain function. It’s not surprising then, that his approaches include game theory as well as measuring the firing of single neurons. Glimcher’s talk details his research from the past 15 years, what he describes as an attempt to “add something” to the classic studies on the basal ganglia circuit conducted by fellow symposium speaker Okihide Hikosaka. From Hikosaka’s data and other research, Glimcher came to believe that neurons of the substantia nigra (part of the basal ganglia) were coding for something of worth to an animal, but that these neurons were “responding not to reward per se, but to deviations to expectation.” For instance, if a pigeon expected a delivery of millet seed following a conditioned cue, no neurons fired, but if the reward was delayed, then suddenly delivered, the pigeon would find its initial prediction in error, and its neurons burst into action.    Various models emerged to capture the ways in which these neurons, energized primarily by the neurotransmitter dopamine, enabled animals to adjust expectations about and predict rewards. But Glimcher found fault with others scientists’ “conditional parameters.” He says, “As an economist, this is frustrating.” So he developed three mathematical axioms for testing the so-called Reward Prediction Error (RPE) models. His work “suggested a way of unifying the data,” with the notion that the basal ganglia learns “the values of actions in a quantitative way … from the dopamine neurons and the incoming stimulus.”    Glimcher hypothesized that dopamine neurons take the value of a reward just received, “and subtract it from a weighted exponential average of previous rewards, and if there’s no mismatch, there should be no firing of…dopamine neurons.” Human, monkey and pigeon studies -- based on gambling, juice, and seed rewards, respectively -- solidified his notion that dopamine neurons are part of an RPE encoding system where they convey the differences between rewards expected and rewards received. This has led Glimcher to believe that “one of the principle functions of the basal ganglia is to learn the values of our actions, represent them, and pump out the data to produce choice.”"}

Although the questions posed are fundamentally biological questions, the methods for answering these questions are inherently multidisciplinary.

In connection with all the topics covered, we will consider both theory and experiment.

Intra-class variability is the curse of most high-dimensional  signal classifications. Fighting it means finding informative  invariants.

In many applications, however, this model must be learned using a finite set of trajectories. When this data proves difficult or expensive to collect, it is often the case that the resulting model is poorly or imprecisely defined.    In this talk, I will present two recent results on the topic of decision-making under model uncertainty. In the first half, I will describe a method for estimating the bias and variance of the value function in terms of the statistics of the empirical transition and observation model. Such error terms can be used to meaningfully compare the value of different policies. In the second half, I will present a bayesian approach designed to simultaneously improve the model and select good actions. Performance of the two methods will be illustrated using problems drawn from the fields of robotics and medical treatment design. "}

In decades of research, he has taken firm hold of the metrics of measuring mortality in flight. While there are many ways of looking at the grim numbers, Barnett has developed his own preferred ratio, which looks at “death risk per randomly chosen flight.” Applying this approach, Barnett has come up with very reassuring statistics: The death risk per flight on first world domestic jet services, for the period of 1990-1999, was 1 in 13 million. To the air averse, Barnett offers that “a citizen is 2.5 times as likely to win the jackpot of the Massachusetts state lottery as to perish on his or her next flight.” For the four years between 2000 and 2004, there were zero accidental deaths in 70 million first world flights. Airline safety has tangibly improved, says Barnett. But security is another matter entirely: “We lost it all on a Tuesday in September,” he says. While we’ve “brought accidents to the brink of extinction”, we haven’t solved our problems “dealing with the forces of evil.” He strongly urges the reintroduction of positive passenger-baggage match, which he believes will deter terrorists who may use flawed explosive detection devices “as roulette wheels.”    As for fixing the Electoral College, which he likens to tilting at windmills, Barnett proposes applying a weighted average. This would “all but eliminate the worse consequences of the winner take all rule.” The biggest drawback? “People have difficulty with mathematical ideas. And this sounds complicated.”"}

Unveiling the salient  physical events that underly a functional image is most appropriately  addressed by feature extraction methods that exploit  the domain-specific knowledge combined with spatial  relations at multiple abstraction levels and scales. The identification  of specific patterns that are known to characterize  classes of pathologies provides an important support to the  diagnosis of disturbances, and the assessment of organ functions.  In this work we focus on Electrocardiographic diagnosis  based on epicardial activation fields. This kind of data,  which can now be obtained non invasively from body surface  data through mathematical model-based reconstruction methods,  can hit electrical conduction pathologies that routine surface  ECGs may miss. However, their analysis/interpretation  still requires highly specialized skills that belong to few experts.  Given an epicardial activation field, the automated detection  of salient patterns in it, grounded on the existing interpretation  rationale, would represent a major contribution  towards the clinical use of such valuable tools whose diagnostic  potential is still largely unexplored. We focus on epicardial  activation isochronal maps, which convey information  about the heart electric function in terms of the depolarization  wavefront kinematics. An approach grounded on the integration  of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) method with concepts  borrowed from Computational Geometry provides a computational  framework to extract, from the given activation data,  a few basic features that characterize the wavefront propagation,  as well as a more specific set of diagnostic features  that identify an important class of heart rhythm pathologies,  namely reentry arrhythmias due to block of conduction.  Keywords: Biomedical imaging; functional imaging; image  based diagnosis; spatial aggregation; computational geometry;  electrocardiography; cardiac electrical function."}

However, as the analysis of these images is done mostly by hand, there is a severe bottleneck in transforming these images into useful quantitative data that can be used to evaluate mathematical models.  One of the inherent challenges involved in automating this transformation is that image data is highly variable. This requires a recalibration of the image processing algorithms for each experiment. We use machine learning methods to enable the experimentalist to calibrate the image processing methods without having any knowledge of how these methods work. This, we believe, will allow the rapid integration of computer vision methods with confocal microscopy and open the way to the development of quantitative spatial models of cellular processes.

Many important retrieval and mining tasks rely on ranking the data items based on their centrality or prestige in the network. Beyond prestige, diversity has been recognized as a crucial objective in ranking, aiming at providing a non-redundant and high coverage piece of information in the top ranked results. Nevertheless, existing network-based ranking approaches either disregard the concern of diversity, or handle it with non-optimized heuristics, usually based on greedy vertex selection.   We propose a novel ranking algorithm, DivRank, based on a reinforced random walk in an information network. This model automatically balances the prestige and the diversity of the top ranked vertices in a principled way. DivRank not only has a clear optimization explanation, but also well connects to classical models in mathematics and network science. We evaluate DivRank using empirical experiments on three different networks as well as a text summarization task. DivRank outperforms existing network-based ranking methods in terms of enhancing diversity in prestige. "}

Those talks were aimed at advanced graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, and faculty colleagues. From this group the suggestion emerged that a somewhat complete set of lectures on continuum aspects of materials physics would be useful. The lectures that you are about to dive into were recorded over a six-week period at the University. Given their origin, they are meant to be early steps on a path of research in continuum physics for the entrant to this area, and I daresay a second opinion for the more seasoned exponent of the science. The potential use of this series as an enabler of more widespread research in continuum physics is as compelling a motivation for me to record and offer it, as is its potential as an open online class.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis first edition of the lectures appears as a collection of around 130 segments (I confess, I have estimated, but not counted) of between 12 and 30 minutes each. The recommended single dose of online instruction is around 15 minutes. This is a recommendation that I have flouted with impunity, hiding behind the need to tell a detailed and coherent story in each segment. Still, I have been convinced to split a number of the originally longer segments. This is the explanation for the proliferation of Parts I, II and sometimes even III, with the same title. Sprinkled among the lecture segments are responses to questions that arose from a small audience of students and post-doctoral scholars who followed the recordings live. There also are assignments and tests.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp variable\u003d\\\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/variable#\\\"\u003eThe roughly 130 segments have been organized into 13 units, each of which may be a chapter in a book. The first 10 units are standard fare from the continuum mechanics courses I have taught at University of Michigan over the last 14 years. As is my preference, I have placed equal emphasis on solids and fluids, insisting that one cannot fully appreciate the mechanical state of one of these forms of matter without an equal appreciation of the other. At my pace of classroom teaching, this stretch of the subject would take me in the neighborhood of 25 lectures of 80 minutes each. At the end of the tenth of these units, I have attempted, perhaps clumsily, to draw a line by offering a roadmap of what the viewer could hope to do with what she would have learned up to that point. It is there that I acknowledge the modern masters of continuum mechanics by listing the books that, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, will enlighten the reader far above my poor power to add or detract.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt this point the proceedings also depart from the script of continuum mechanics, and become qualified for the mantle of Continuum Physics. The next three units are on thermomechanics, variational principles and mass transport--subjects that I have learned from working in these areas, and have been unable to incorporate in regular classes for a sheer want of time. In the months and years to come, new editions of these Lectures on Continuum Physics will feature an enhancement of breadth and depth of these three topics, as well as topics in addition to them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp variable\u003d\\\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/variable#\\\"\u003eFinally, a word on the treatment of the subject: it is mathematical. I know of no other way to do continuum physics. While being rigorous (I hope) it is, however, neither abstract nor formal. In every segment I have taken pains to make connections with the physics of the subject. Props, simple but instructive, have been used throughout. A deformable plastic bottle, water and food color have been used--effectively, I trust. The makers of Lego, I believe, will find reason to be pleased.

Perhaps no one understands Turing’s role during this period -- and his larger impact on mathematics and computing -- like B. Jack Copeland. In this lecture, Copeland contends that Turing should be celebrated as the father of artificial intelligence.  He dates the origins of AI “to the dark days in 1940, 1941” when Turing and fellow code-breakers were pitted against the Nazi code machine Enigma. Copeland describes how Turing broke the previously inviolable indicator system of Enigma, and helped design electromechanical machines to read thousands of German radio intercepts. These devices employed heuristic searching, which is now a central idea of AI. They found the right answer “often enough and fast enough to be read in real time.” Without such machines, German U-boats would have decimated the North Atlantic convoys providing a lifeline to Britain.  Copeland notes that Turing was hooked on this idea of heuristic problem solving, and that he speculated on building sophisticated machines by “making use of guided search.” Well before the breakout of war, Turing had conceived of a general computing machine that stored programs in memory. The world’s first large-scale, electronic computer, Colossus was used at Bletchley to break other Nazi codes, and Turing found additional inspiration for pursuing ideas of machine intelligence. “Nowadays when nearly everyone owns the physical realization of a universal Turing machine, Turing’s idea of a one-stop shop computing machine is apt to seem as obvious as the wheel,” says Copeland. But in 1936, engineers “thought in terms of building specific machines for particular purposes.” Turing’s idea was revolutionary.  After the war, Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory and developed the schematics for an Automatic Computing Engine, intended as the first electronic stored-program general-purpose digital computer. AI was central to his vision, believes Copeland. He described this project as “building a brain.” Turing speculated about constructing networks of unorganized, artificial neurons that could be trained to carry out particular tasks. He also published an account of the Turing Test, a method for determining whether a computer “thinks.” Finally, Copeland defends the Turing Test against its many detractors, and predicts that “the probability of AI getting its act together in 50 years to produce a machine that can pass the Turing Test is pretty good.”"}

Ma jor features of our approach include: 1) its flexibility to handle correlations among bins/dimensions; 2) widespread applicability without being limited to ad hoc backgrounds; and 3) a \\\"real\\\" global solution in contrast to existing traditional local approaches. The technical essence of our approach is to fit a parametric distribution to the observed empirical data in the simplex. The distribution is parameterized by affinities between simplex vertices, which is learned via maximizing likelihood of observed data. Then, these affinities induce a metric on the simplex, defined as the earth mover\u0027s distance equipped with ground distances derived from simplex vertex affinities."}

For example, in [1, 2, 3], we have proposed an asymptotically stabilization method based on properties of physical systems such as passivity and invariance for a class of nonlinear stochastic systems. Besides, in [4, 5], we have proposed a stochastic bounded stabilization controller, which renders the state of the plant system bounded in probability for given probability and bounds of the state. The main subject of this talk is nonlinear optimal control, and I would like to introduce our recent research with Prof. Bert Kappen, on extension of the path integral stochastic optimal control method. Nonlinear stochastic optimal control problem is reduced to solving the stochastic Hamilton- Jacobi-Bellman (SHJB) equation. However, it is generally quite difficult to solve the SHJB equation, because it is a second-order nonlinear PDE. The path integral method proposed by Kappen [6] provides an efficient solution for a SHJB equation corresponding to a class of nonlinear stochastic optimal control problems, based on statistical physics approach. Although this method is very useful, some assumptions required in this method restrict its application. To solve this problem, we have proposed an iterative solution for the path integral method in our report [7]. The proposed method solves the SHJB equation iteratively without imposing the assumptions, which are necessary in the conventional method. Consequently, it enables us to solve a wider class of stochastic optimal control problems based on the path integral approach. Since the proposed method reduces to the conventional method when the assumptions hold, it is considered to be a natural extension of the conventional result. Furthermore, we investigate a convergence property of the algorithm.\\  [1] S. Satoh and K.

The goal is to recover each speech signal from the microphone inputs. Mathematically this can be modeled by assuming that we are given samples from a n-dimensional random variable X\u003dAS, where S is a vector whose coordinates are independent random variables corresponding to each speaker. The objective is to recover the matrix A?1 given random samples from X. A range of techniques collectively known as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have been proposed to address this problem in the signal processing and machine learning literature. Many of these techniques are based on using the kurtosis or other cumulants to recover the components. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for solving the blind signal separation problem in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, when we are given samples from X\u003dAS+?, where ? is drawn from an unknown, not necessarily spherical n-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Our approach is based on a method for decorrelating a sample with additive Gaussian noise under the assumption that the underlying distribution is a linear transformation of a distribution with independent components. Our decorrelation routine is based on the properties of cumulant tensors and can be combined with any standard cumulant-based method for ICA to get an algorithm that is provably robust in the presence of Gaussian noise. We derive polynomial bounds for sample complexity and error propagation of our method."}

But it is neither meant to be a history of the exact sciences per se nor an annex to, say, the Course 6 curriculum in probability and statistics. Rather, our objective is to focus on the formal, thematic, and rhetorical features that imaginative literature shares with texts in the history of probability. These shared issues include (but are not limited to): the attempt to quantify or otherwise explain the presence of chance, risk, and contingency in everyday life; the deduction of causes for phenomena that are knowable only in their effects; and, above all, the question of what it means to think and act rationally in an uncertain world. Our course therefore aims to broaden students\u0027 appreciation for and understanding of how literature interacts with – both reflecting upon and contributing to – the scientific understanding of the world. We are just as centrally committed to encouraging students to regard imaginative literature as a unique contribution to knowledge in its own right, and to see literary works of art as objects that demand and richly repay close critical analysis. It is our hope that the course will serve students well if they elect to pursue further work in Literature or other discipline in SHASS, and also enrich or complement their understanding of probability and statistics in other scientific and engineering subjects they elect to take."}

However, according to Professor Kagan, this fact angered many cities. Therefore, Thrasybulus, along with the help of other poleis, resisted Spartan rule.

The process is thus necessarily incremental and relies on clearly defined objectives to succeed in improving the efficiency of ICT use in education. This document presents major themes to assist educators in better integrating ICT with their teaching, and particularly allowing them to offer higher quality distance education programs to Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics students.

At Bauman MSTU since the end of 1970’s there have been worked out methods, algorithms and software package “CAR” (Conduction and Radiation) for solving direct problems (DP) and inverse problems (IP) of RCHT in composite materials and constructions. Numerical methods of solving DP, extreme statements of IP, numerical optimization of residual functionals and iterative regularization methods form the theoretical base of the package “CAR” approaches. The package “CAR” was used for researches on project reusable launch vehicles “Buran”, “Hopper”, large space frame “SOFORA”, large deployable space antenna NPO EGS. For today the software package “CAR” is the base for the current studies of advanced materials for aerospace applications and in development of new manufacturing technologies.  In the lecture two branches of RCHT IP application are presented. The first branch connected with studies of advanced materials thermophysical properties. The statements are formulated as coefficient IP. Short description of experimental technique and some features of combined heat transfer in porous semitransparent material are given. The second branch connected with designing new manufacturing technologies for ceramics and glass. The statements are formulated as boundary IP and assume the determination of time variation of incident heat flux on the glass surface.

A key challenge in clinical metabonomics is uncovering and understanding the relations between the multidimensional spectroscopic data and the clinical measures currently used for disease risk assessment and diagnostics. A novel Bayesian approach for revealing clinically relevant signals is presented here for a real 1H NMR metabonomics data set. The results are not only mathematically superior but also biochemically fully coherent."}

Recent work has developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities. However, these approaches are less well suited to the identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order of days --- the time scale at which we perceive news and events.    We develop a framework for tracking short, distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a daily basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle --- the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a ``heartbeat\u0027\u0027-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. We also develop and analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation that the system exhibits."}

Students in this class have already taken a course in \\\"Transport Phenomena\\\" in the second year, and \\\"Fluid Flow Heat and Mass Transfer\\\" is designed as a follow-up to that class, with an emphasis on topics of importance in applied earth sciences, and in particular to Petroleum Engineering, groundwater flow and mining.             In practice, however I start over again with first principles with this class, because the initial concepts of the shell balance are difficult for students to grasp and can always use a second time through.  The course covers simple fluid mechanics problems (rectilinear flow) using shell balances, for Newtonian and power-law fluids and Bingham plastics.  Turbulence for Newtonian fluids is covered in the context of friction factors for flow in pipes, flow around spheres and flow in packed beds.             In heat transfer we start again with shell balances for solving simple steady-state conduction problems.  Thereafter, special attention is given to unsteady and multidimensional heat conduction, since the equations are similar for unsteady flow in aquifers and petroleum reservoirs.  The concepts of orthogonal conduction and superposition are emphasized, as well as ways to treat perfectly insulated boundaries.             The final topic in heat transfer is estimation of heat-transfer coefficients in flow in tubes. Although no other geometries are treated explicitly, I hope students recognize certain principles they can apply to other situations.     We cover mass transfer only lightly, and only as by analogy to heat conduction: unsteady diffusion (by analogy to unsteady head conduction) and mass transfer in tubes (by analogy to heat transfer in tubes).     The course seeks to emphasize intuitive and physical understanding of concepts and goes relatively lightly on math.  In the study of unsteady conduction, for instance, students are not required to solve the partial differential equations, but to use and combine tabulated solutions to solve for temperature or heat transfer as a function of time in various geometries.             There is a laboratory exercise in the class, which is not shown in the lectures.  The lab description is provided on the OpenCourseWare site, and one lecture discusses how to use the data in the lab to do the calculations in the report.  In this problem students measure the heating of rectangular solid blocks from a cylindrical heater.  Mathematically, this process of unsteady heat conduction is similar to Darcy flow in a well test in a geological formation.             From 1989 to 2006 I taught a similar course at The University of Texas at Austin; that course had course number PGE 322K, entitled \\\"Transport Phenomena in Geosystems Engineering.\\\"  A similar course I taught to graduate students was PGE387L.  You may see references to these course numbers in some places in the lecture notes.  The subjects covered in those courses differ a bit from what is taught in ta3220.  As a result; you may, for instance, see a homework problem scratched out among the worked problems.  In that case, the reason is that given problem is on a subject not covered in ta3220."}

Susan Hockfield views MIT’s Center for Cancer Research as a central example of how “life sciences are coming into conversation with engineering in a powerful way.” Robert Silbey  provides historical background on the notion of faculty ‘short courses’, and positions the Center as “the jewel in the crown of MIT, a spawning ground for scientific discovery and rewards.”  Tyler Jacks introduces the key research areas and scientists who will speak in the succeeding sessions. He offers a thumbnail sketch of cancer as a molecular genetic progression involving sequential alterations in, and the proliferation of, abnormal cells. “Think of a cancer cell like an integrated circuit: the same kinds of complexities in electronic networks also exist within cells,” notes Jacks. Because of work on the human genome, and advances in scientists’ ability to untangle these complex molecular interactions, “We now have the first generation of anti-cancer drugs targeted against molecular alterations in cancer,” says Jacks. Two highly successful drugs have already been derived from MIT research.  In addition, says Jacks, collaboration among biologists, engineers and mathematicians are yielding “a tremendous collection of tools and technologies.” These include tiny probes that enable diagnosis of cancers at earlier stages, nanoparticles that deliver a therapeutic payload directly to cancer cells, and devices that can be implanted in the body."}

The earliest PK models were physiological and mechanistic in the sense that they started from a mathematical description of the body as organs of given composition and properties, linked by blood flow. For a while, the lack of fast methods for solving differential equation systems led to the formulation and use of empirical and much simpler compartmental models. Interest in physiologically based (PBPK) modelling has persisted, however, in toxicology where data are sparse, and where transpositions from animals to humans are best grounded in physiology and biochemistry. Advances in Bayesian numerical analysis now allow rigorous inferences for PBPK models, including in the context of complex data structures (e.g., hierarchical or \\\"population\\\" models)."}

September 2009 Suitable for Undergraduate study and community education Dr Will Bowden, Associate Professor of Roman Archaeology, Department of Archaeology Dr Will Bowden\u0027s previous research activity includes work on the Samnite cemetery and 12th century abbey at San Vincenzo al Volturno (Italy), survey of the Basilica of the Forty Martyrs (Albania), and survey of the cathedral complex at Jerash (Jordan) (in collaboration with Prof. Beat Brenk (University of Rome, La Sapienza)). He has also worked extensively on the use of the past in constructing present identities in Greece and Albania. Current Project activity includes work on the Caistor Roman Town project and the Butrint Project (Albania). The Butrint Project (Albania) is an interdisciplinary research project focused on the ancient and medieval town of Butrint on the coast of southern Albania. Involved with the project since its inception in 1994 Dr Will Bowden\u0027s current role within the project is concerned with the publication of the 1994-2003 excavations of the Triconch Palace (a major late Roman town-house) and the publication of the excavations of a Roman villa and early Christian church at the site of Diaporit, where he directed excavations from 2000-2004. The Caistor St Edmund Roman Town project is a new research initiative focused on the Roman town of Venta Icenorum, which was established in the territory of the Iceni in the aftermath of the Boudican revolt of AD 60-61. Research here is intended to chart the effects of the town\u0027s foundation on its surrounding area and to examine the development and eventual decline of the settlement. The project is being developed in collaboration with South Norfolk Council and the Norfolk Archaeological Trust and one of its key aims is to use ongoing research to encourage wider recognition and public enjoyment of this important Roman site."}

He demonstrates how small agricultural enclaves eventually turned into great cities of power and wealth in the Bronze Age, taking as his examples first Minoan Crete and then Mycenaean Greece. He also argues that these civilizations were closely related to the great monarchies of the ancient Near East. He points out that the Mycenaean age eventually came to an abrupt end probably through a process of warfare and migration. Reconstructing the Mycenaean age is possible through archaeological evidence and through epic poetry (Homer). Finally, he provides an account of the collapse of the Mycenaean world, and explains how in its aftermath, the Greeks were poised to start their civilization over on a new slate.  **Reading assignment**:  Pomeroy, Burstein, Donlan and Roberts.

The data generated in these projects tend to be heterogeneous and often involves high-throughput \\\"omics\\\" analyses. Models are developed iteratively from data generated in the projects and from the literature. Consequently, there is a growing requirement for exchanging experimental data, mathematical models, and scientific protocols between consortium members and a necessity to record and share the outcomes of experiments and the links between data and models.    The SEEK is an open-source, web-based platform for the management and exchange of Systems Biology data, models and processes. It was originally developed in the SysMO-DB project (http://www.sysmodb.org) for the pan-European SysMO consortia (Systems Biology of Micro Organisms). However, it is now also being adopted by a large number of other consortia across Europe, for example, the Virtual Liver, EviMalar and Unicellsys.   The SysMO-DB solution is being developed in close collaboration with the users, and with a very pragmatic approach, trying to adapt to the common procedures of users and combining this with methods and technologies that allow an effective dissemination, linkage and exchange of data and information.     Underlying the SEEK is the JERM (Just Enough Results Model), which is a minimum information model describing the structure and content of the SEEK assets and relationships between them. A JERM for any one type of data (i.e. microarray data, or metabolomic data) is the minimum data schema that SysMO projects agree to share. This is used to create JERM templates. SysMO-DB leverages these minimum models wherever possible, enabling easy export and publishing of SysMO data to public repositories. In addition, we have developed RightField (the Spreadsheet Ontology Annotation tool) to help researchers to develop templates for experimental data with embedded semantic descriptions. Data can then be consistently annotated with terms from appropriate ontologies and controlled vocabularies consistently. The SEEK provides an access control layer to enable researchers to restrict access to their data to collaborators and colleagues or to share it with the wider community.     Availability: SEEK code is open source and available for download http://code.google.com/p/sysmo-db/.

Quantifying and reducing this uncertainty requires the combination of mathematical models for ecological processes, and earth observation data, within a unifying statistical framework. The Centre for Terrestrial Carbon Dynamics (CTCD) is developing several computer codes to simulate the relevant processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Inputs to theses codes at a given site describe the characteristics of the vegetation grown there. Soil and climate data are also used to drive the model. My talk will illustrate the use of efficient Bayesian tools both in the development of these codes and in their use for prediction and uncertainty reduction. The first step is to build an emulator of the computer code. The emulator is a statistical representation of the code output based on a Gaussian process prior model. From this we can derive inferences about a range of sensitivity and uncertainty measures: Sensitivity analysis is performed to find out the level of influence each input or group of inputs have on the output. This can lead to efficiency gains by revealing inactive inputs. Examination of the expected response curve of the output as a function of individual inputs has also uncovered a number of coding errors. Uncertainty analysis is employed to assess the uncertainty in the prediction resulting from the various uncertain input conditions. It also tells us where to concentrate research effort in reducing uncertainties in inputs if we want to reduce the total uncertainty in the output. Conventional approaches to sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis involve Monte Carlo sampling of code outputs. This is highly inefficient and is not feasible for complex models. Bayesian methods can reduce the required number of simulator runs by several orders of magnitude. I will also mention some extensions to the methodology that are being developed to handle the dynamic and multivariate nature of the CTCD vegetation models."}

Although thousands of schoolchildren in that country were designing and building robots using the Lego Mindstorm kits Resnick helped invent, Singapore businesses complained that when these same students hit the workplace, they lacked creativity and initiative. Resnick discovered, in conversations with teachers, that robot building was an after-school activity, and classroom time was devoted to math and science drills.  This is Resnick’s issue in a nutshell, he explains. “The way technology is getting out there is limited.” If the “richest learning experience happens when people are actively designing, experimenting and exploring,” then why can’t we extend this approach into the school curriculum? Computers and technology should not be used merely to impart information, but to engage kids to design, create and invent – much as little kids do with blocks and paint in kindergarten.  Resnick demonstrates the creations of children who participated in special engineering and software designing courses. He had posed the challenge of inventing something that could be useful to them in everyday life. The results included such unique items as an odometer for roller blades, a diary security system, an automatic toilet paper dispenser and a mobile, wearable juke box. Resnick has launched Computer Clubhouses in locations around the world where kids often have no access to computers. He believes that “success for an individual or a country as a whole will depend on acting creatively.”  Audience questions focused on how to encourage U.S. schools to adopt Resnick’s ideas, given the emphasis on teaching to the test, and the lack of teacher support."}

While the incorporation of monotonicity constraints  is rather simple for certain types of models, it may become a more  intricate problem for others. By trend, the difficulty of ensuring monotonicity  increases with the flexibility or, say, nonlinearity of a model. In  this paper, we advocate the so-called Choquet integral as a tool for learning  monotone nonlinear models. While being widely used as a flexible  aggregation operator in different fields, such as multiple criteria decision  making, the Choquet integral is much less known in machine learning so  far. Apart from combining monotonicity and flexibility in a mathematically  sound and elegant manner, the Choquet integral has additional  features making it attractive from a machine learning point of view.  Notably, it offers measures for quantifying the importance of individual  predictor variables and the interaction between groups of variables. As  a concrete application of the Choquet integral, we propose a generalization  of logistic regression. The basic idea of our approach, referred  to as choquistic regression, is to replace the linear function of predictor  variables, which is commonly used in logistic regression to model the log  odds of the positive class, by the Choquet integral."}

First, we propose a graph generator that is mathematically tractable   and generates realistic graphs. The main idea is to use a non-standard   matrix operation, the Kronecker product, to generate graphs that we   refer to as \u0027\u0027Kronecker graphs\u0027\u0027. We show that Kronecker graphs   naturally obey all the above properties; in fact, we can rigorously   prove that they do so.      Once we have the model, we fit it to real graph to generate a synthetic   graph that matches its properties, i.e., it has similar degree distribution,   similar (small) diameter, similar spectrum, etc?      We present a fast and scalable algorithm for fitting the Kronecker graph   generation model to real networks. A naive approach to fitting would   take super-exponential time. In contrast, our algorithm takes linear time,   by exploiting the structure of Kronecker matrix multiplication and by   using sampling.      Experiments on large real and synthetic graphs show that our approach   recovers the true parameters and indeed mimics very well the patterns   found in the target graphs. Once fitted, the model parameters and the   resulting synthetic graphs can be used for anonymization, extrapolations,   and graph summarization.      //The presentation starts in Slovenian language and switches to English a few minutes into the lecture.\\   Another lecture on the same topic can be found at [[icml07_leskovec_smrg]].//"}

This, says Yaffe, is enough to go around the circumference of the earth more than 22 times. What’s more, the cell has to copy its DNA with no errors. “I don’t know (if) civil engineers ... could make 10 miles of road without making single error,” says Yaffe.  In the 12 hours a cell takes to copy its DNA to create two daughter cells, “it goes to great pains to make sure everything is done correctly. It initiates checkpoints, like border crossings.” Because everyday life exposes DNA to all kinds of damage, cells have evolved “an elaborate surveillance mechanism” to “blow the whistle, signal repair, and recruit repair machinery,” or if damage is too great, essentially commit suicide. If something goes wrong with this mechanism at crucial times during cell division, cancer frequently results.  Yaffe’s in the business of exploring and mathematically mapping the elaborate signal pathways inside cells that sense broken DNA and coordinate damage response. While studying one such process, cell death in the colon, Yaffe found that the traditional biochemistry approach -- picking one molecule, one stimulus and one readout-- doesn’t work. “It’s like the blind man feeling the elephant’s tail, and saying it’s a long, thin animal.” Yaffe learned that one signal may activate a series of proteins, triggering an amplification loop. A slight change might yield a “whopping response.”  Just as engineers test integrated circuits at a variety of points, Yaffe came up with a method of testing cell signaling with a variety of proteins. His team came up with 7,000 signaling measurements in 760 dimensions, and 1,400 signal responses. But this data-heavy model for predicting which molecules lead to cell death didn’t satisfy Yaffe. With additional mathematical sleight of hand, Yaffe’s group boiled down the cell signaling measurements to what Yaffe calls two “canonical super axes”: “a global measure of cell stress and death, and another of survival signaling.” He hopes to use this slimmed-down model to think about drugs targeting cancer and inflammation."}

Because a great number of machine learning and data mining applications need proximity measures over data, a simple and universal distance metric is desirable, and metric learning methods have been explored to produce sensible distance measures consistent with data relationship. However, most existing methods suffer from limited labeled data and expensive training. In this paper, we address these two issues through employing abundant unlabeled data and pursuing sparsity of metrics, resulting in a novel metric learning approach called semi-supervised sparse metric learning. Two important contributions of our approach are: 1) it propagates scarce prior affinities between data to the global scope and incorporates the full affinities into the metric learning; and 2) it uses an efficient alternating linearization method to directly optimize the sparse metric. Compared with conventional methods, ours can effectively take advantage of semi-supervision and automatically discover the sparse metric structure underlying input data patterns. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach with extensive experiments carried out on six datasets, obtaining clear performance gains over the state-of-the-arts."}

The overlapping generations model, invented by Allais and Samuelson but here augmented with land, represents such a situation. Financial equilibrium can again be reduced to general equilibrium. At first glance it would seem that the model requires a solution of an infinite number of supply equals demand equations, one for each time period. But by assuming stationarity, the whole analysis can be reduced to one equation. In this mathematical framework we reach an even more precise and subtle understanding of Social Security and the real rate of interest. We find that Social Security likely increases the real rate of interest. The presence of land, an infinitely lived asset that pays a perpetual dividend, forces the real rate of interest to be positive, exposing the flaw in Samuelson\u0027s contention that Social Security is a giant, yet beneficial, Ponzi scheme where each generation can win by perpetually deferring a growing cost.

It turns out that many of these techniques fall under the category of Monte Carlo Optimization. In this technique, we present a brief statistical analysis of Monte Carlo Optimization (MCO), and show that it is identical to Parametric Machine Learning (PL).

In order to address these limitations, we propose a mathematical and algorithmic framework for learning to aggregate (partial) rankings without supervision.

The talk will touch on our early work on multiresolution tree models (motivated by wavelets but only indirectly relevant to them), the way control theorists think of inference and approximate modeling / stochastic realization, with at least one application that rings of the way a machine learning researcher might build a model – but not a mathematical physicist! I’ll provide (finally) a real rapprochement with wavelets and then turn to approximate inference on loopy graphs.     The first approach builds on an idea used in the solution of PDEs, namely nested dissection, but with some machine learning twists, and some control-theoretic stability issues (showing how control might have a few things to provide to inference algorithm designers). I will then turn to a topic again related to the ways in which numerical linear algebraists think about solving sparse systems of equations, but in the context of graphical models, this leads to the idea of walk-sum analysis, a surprisingly useful (and at least I think intuitive) idea. Walk-sum analysis then allows us to say some fairly strong things about a variety of iterative algorithms (generally known as either Richardson iterations, Jacobi iterations, or Gauss-Seidel iterations), including adaptive algorithms to guide iterations for fast convergence. Walk-sum analysis is also key in another approach with linear algebraic interpretations, involving so-called feedback vertex sets. I will also touch on an alarmingly accurate method for computing variances in graphical models that involves using a low-rank approximation to the identity matrix(!) and then return to multiresolution models but now looking at models motivated by two quite different classes of numerical algorithms: multigrid algorithms and multipole algorithms. These algorithms motivate two quite different classes of models, the latter of which requires the introduction of what we refer to as conjugate graphs. If I have any time and energy left, I will comment on some prospective topics."}

The purpose of these demonstrations is to make mathematical analysis of electromagnetism take on physical meaning. Based on relatively simple configurations and arrangements of equipment, they make a direct connection between what has been analytically derived and what is observed. They permit the student to observe physically what has been described symbolically.

One possible way of combining different types of features, e.g. color- and texture features on different scales and/or different orientations, is to simply stack all the individual measurements into one high-dimensional feature vector. Due to the nature of such stacked vectors, however, only very few components (e.g. those which are defined on a suitable scale) will carry information that is relevant for the actual segmentation task. We present a novel approach to combining segmentation and feature selection that is capable of overcoming this relevance determination problem. It implements a wrapper strategy for feature selection, in the sense that the features are directly selected by optimizing thediscriminative power of the used partitioning algorithm. On the technical side, we present an efficient optimization algorithm with guaranteed local convergence property. All free model parameters of this method are selected by a resampling-based stability analysis. Experiments for both toy examples and real-world images demonstrate that the built-in feature selection mechanism leads to stable and meaningful partitions of the images."}

We describe a metric called pSkip that aims to quantify the ranking quality by estimating the probability of users encountering non relevant results that cost them the efforts to read and skip. A search engine with a lower pSkip is regarded as having a better ranking quality. A key design goal of pSkip is to integrate the findings from two sets of user studies that utilize eye-tracking devices to track users\u0019 browsing patterns on the search result pages, and that use specially instrumented browsers to actively solicit users\u0019 explicit judgments on their search activities. We present the derivation of the maximum likelihood estimation of pSkip and demonstrate its efficacy in describing the user study data. The mathematical properties of pSkip are further analyzed and compared with several objective metrics as well as the cumulated gain method that uses subjective judgments. Experimental data show that pSkip can measure aspects of the search quality that these existing metrics are not designed or fail to address, such as identifying the real search intents expressed in the ambiguous queries. Although effective and superior in many ways, we also report a series of experiments that show pSkip may be influenced by system issues that are not directly related to relevance ranking, suggesting that measurements complementary to pSkip are still needed in order to form a holistic and accurate characterization of the ranking quality.

They arose in a context in which it was expected that a finitary proof of consistency of arithmetic would shortly be forthcoming. This followed the proposal by the mathematician David Hilbert (1862-1943) for the complete axiomatisation and formalisation of all mathematical knowledge and proofs. Although committed to formal methods, many of Hilbert’s proofs were existential in nature, which ran counter to the finitistic, constructivist methods of mathematics. To deal with this criticism, Hilbert proposed that the formal methods program should establish that all of the “Ideal” existential arguments could in principle be replaced by “Real” constructive arguments, by showing some sort of conservation result. However, the incompleteness results showed that this ‘program’ could not be carried out in a simple way."}

I don\u0027t know the answer to it, but I wanted to explain that if I try my best to make the equations look as near as possible to what would be imitable by a classical probabilistic computer, I get into trouble\u0027//    These are the words of Richard Feynman in a famous keynote talk on Simulating Physics with Computers. He was pointing out that we have to face an intrinsic conceptual difficulty if we want to understand the world through mimicking its behaviour with computational systems. Actually, we do not have to go as esoteric as quantum physics. We see some of the same issues in Machine Learning and inference from probabilistic estimators in data-driven modelling. And in the same way that Feynman did not know the resolution to his problem, we are only just starting to become aware of some of our own problems in machine intelligence. The principled approach to Machine Intelligence that we have now come to accept is through a probabilistic viewpoint. The Bayesian view of inference is a subjective one and our knowledge of the universe derives from observation. But I will argue that the use of Machine Learning to represent or simulate the universe only allows generically non-positive probabilities! Of course, we can fudge some of the more uncomfortable aspects that some of these issues raise, but it still should make us think about whether we have got the correct working framework. In this talk I want to question parts of our working machinery we use in Machine Learning. At its heart I want to challenge the assumption that probabilities have to be positive. I want to give several arguments, descriptive and formal, to indicate why the use of positive probabilities is an ideal which is both overly restrictive and unrealisable. Indeed I will argue that the use of non-positive `probabilities\u0027 is both inevitable and natural. To do this I will need to use some old mathematical ideas from classical statistics and some more modern ideas from information theory. I will use some simple examples and proofs from Machine Learning applied to regression and classification tasks, and draw parallels with some basic quantum theory ideas. The core of the argument is that in modelling the universe through Machine Learning, we are obliged to make inferences based on finite and hence typically less-than-complete information. We can never know everything about a situation, and this gives us our link between quantum mechanics and statistical inference through machine learning. I will try to make a case that inference through any finite data-driven computation leads to this apparent problem with `probabilities\u0027. So the issue is not just connected with quantum mechanics, but is a more generic problem related to trying to simulate even classical probabilities by Machine Learning ideas.

Under conditions of starvation populations of these amoebae aggregate due to chemical waves of cAMP. As a cAMP wave passes by a cell, it moves in the opposite direction, consequently towards the origin of the signal, as long as the cAMP-concentration is increasing over time. Formally this system my be regarded as a complex self-organizing network of cells, communicating through chemical medium. The spatio-temporal patterns of cAMP waves are a manifestation of the intrinsic properties of this active medium. Depending on the experimental conditions either spiral or circular-shaped waves of cAMP arise [2]. Sometimes a pattern of one type  is transformed into the other one in the course of time. In experiments two different examples for transitions from one to the other type of spatio-temporal patterns were reported [3]. In the first case a continuous transition from the spiral type pattern to target waves was observed at the later stages of aggregation. In the second case the transition was induced by a spatially homogeneous cAMP pulse, when after resetting oscillating spots, bearing target patterns emerged instead of the originally present spirals. Similar results were reported by Lee et al. [4]. The biological significance of different types  of cAMP waves for Dictyostelium discoideum morphogenesis and the mechanisms of transitions between them are still unclear. Thus the question arises: what are the internal cellular properties and the external experimental conditions, which lead to such a transition? We attempt to find the answer to  this question applying a mathematical modelling approach."}

The representation defines what information is important about the objects and is used to describe them. The modeling techniques extract the information from images to instantiate the representation for the particular objects present in the scene. In this seminar, we will discuss popular representations (such as contours, level sets, deformation fields) and useful methods that allow us to extract and manipulate image information, including manifold fitting, markov random fields, expectation maximization, clustering and others. For each concept -- a new representation or an estimation algorithm -- a lecture on the mathematical foundations of the concept will be followed by a discussion of two or three relevant research papers in computer vision, medical and biological imaging, that use the concept in different ways. We will aim to understand the fundamental techniques and to recognize situations in which these techniques promise to improve the quality of the analysis."}

The principles of natural selection and variation in a population come into play not only when exploring how children learn language but how languages alter over time.  All languages are learnable and more or less uniformly learnable, says Nyogi: “It doesn’t take 25 years to learn Chinese and two years to learn Bengali.” But in the last 30-odd years, Nyogi says, there’s been a great deal of debate about the most useful models of learning theory, with efforts to explain how the human language faculty makes use of linguistic input at different developmental stages. One model of language acquisition depicts the child, armed with a basic grammar “map,” extrapolating from data (interactions with adults), and assembling the components of language by some algorithm. Analysis has been conducted as if there were “a target grammar, which produces data, and an algorithm which is trying to acquire this target grammar.” But, says Niyogi, “that’s not true in the world.” A child is exposed to lots of variation from within its population; parents and others all produce different grammars, different data sets.  Niyogi believes that an “evolutionary trajectory” links how acquisition happens at an individual level, and how variation in language springs up from one generation to the next. But rather than inheriting the grammar of your parents, you have to learn it. Examining language variation over time as if it were genetic variation, “you get a different mathematical structure…and probabilities start playing an important role.” Small differences “can have very subtle consequences giving rise to bifurcation in nonlinear dynamics of evolution.” For instance, 1000 years ago, the English were speaking a language that’s unrecognizable to us today. How has it come to be that “we have moved so far from that point through learning which is mimicking the previous generation?”  Niyogi explains that within a single population two varying languages may be in competition (say, a German and an English-type grammar). While a majority may speak the dominant variant, some children will likely be exposed to a mixture of the two. There’s a “drift” in language use, “and suddenly, what was stable becomes unstable.” In the next generation, even more learners pick up the minority variant. It’s possible to determine the probability of learners in successive generations using new expressions, and tracking the evolutionary transformation of language. The “ubiquitous fact of languages is that they change with time,” concludes Nyogi, and “even a slight effect of frequency can wipe out something that looks stable.”"}

We consider this problem jointly in the framework of Riemannian symmetric spaces and the framework of Information Geometry. Both approaches lead to the same metric, that has been initially considered in other mathematical domains (study of Bruhat-Tits complete metric Space \u0026 Upper-half Siegel Space in Symplectic Geometry). Based on Frechet-Karcher barycenter definition \u0026 geodesics in Bruhat-Tits space, we address problem of N Covariance matrices Mean estimation. Our main contribution lies in the development of this theory for Complex Autoregressive models (maximum entropy solution of Doppler Spectral Analysis).   Specific Blocks structure of the Toeplitz Hermitian covariance matrix is used to define an iterative \u0026 parallel algorithm for Siegel metric computation. Based on Affine Information Geometry theory, we introduce for Complex Autoregressive Model, Kohler metric on reflection coefficients based on Kohler potential function given by Doppler signal Entropy.

While these approaches found their inspirations in  diverse fields of nascence, they are deeply connected. In this talk,  I will present a practical and unified framework for understanding  some common underpinnings of these methods.

True complexity emerges through the interplay in this hierarchy of bottom-up and top-down effects. The latter are characterised by multiple realisability of higher level functions through lower level entities, inter alia enabling adaptive selection to generate new information from incoming data streams. Computer programs are not physical entities, but are nevertheless causally effective in numerous ways,for example facilitating causal effectiveness of social conventions such as the rules of chess and the value of money, enabling application in engineering and science of non-physical entities such as mathematical relationships and our understanding of physical laws, and facilitating social interaction through numerous applications of the internet. Their development embodies the combined experience of numerous workers in aspects ranging from basic concepts to system design to effective algorithms to high level design patterns, and is based in the extraordinary ability of digital systems to represent language, pictures,sound, mathematical relationships, and indeed all human knowledge. Hence although they are the ultimate in algorithmic causation, as characterized so precisely by Turing machines, digital computers embody and demonstrate the causal efficacy of many kinds of non-physical entities. Developing the analogies between computer systems and biological systems in terms of their structures, functioning, and development may help to understand how truly complex behaviour can emerge from simple constituents."}

For many problem domains, for instance climatology and epidemiology, in addition to local dependencies, we may also wish to model heavy-tailed statistics, where extreme deviations should not be treated as outliers. Specifying such distributions using graphical models for probability density functions (PDFs) generally lead to intractable inference and learning. Cumulative distribution networks (CDNs) provide a means to tractably specify multivariate heavy-tailed models as a product of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). Currently, algorithms for inference and learning, which correspond to computing mixed derivatives, are exact only for tree-structured graphs. For graphs of arbitrary topology, an efficient algorithm is needed that takes advantage of the sparse structure of the model, unlike symbolic differentiation programs such as Mathematica and D* that do not. We present an algorithm for recursively decomposing the computation of derivatives for CDNs of arbitrary topology, where the decomposition is naturally described using junction trees. We compare the performance of the resulting algorithm to Mathematica and D*, and we apply our method to learning models for rainfall and H1N1 data, where we show that CDNs with cycles are able to provide a significantly better fits to the data as compared to tree-structured and unstructured CDNs and other heavy-tailed multivariate distributions such as the multivariate copula and logistic models."}

Considerable experimental work is currently going on to study the human psychophysics of scene understanding and sequence generation. Synthesis of that knowledge into a comprehensive account for these competences is much harder to come by. In this project we develop a neurally based theoretical account for scene understanding and sequence generation. Mathematically models formalized in the language of neural dynamics, a space-time continuous version of recurrent neural networks, are implemented in autonomous cognitive robots that have their own sensory and motor systems. Robotic implementation provides a critical reality check on the theory and is a potent source of heuristics, uncovering hitherto overlooked aspects of the problem as well as providing a proof of concept. At the same time, the project is aimed to advance cognitive robots toward increased autonomy. Our most ambitious theoretical goal is to include learning into every aspect of sequence planning and scene perception."}

Despite the recent   advances of the theoretical understanding and the algorithmics of sparse   point estimation, higher-order problems such as covariance estimation or   optimal data acquisition are seldomly addressed for sparsity-favouring mod-   els, and there are virtually no scalable algorithms.   We provide an approximate Bayesian inference algorithm for sparse lin-   ear models, that can be used with hundred thousands of variables. Our   method employs a convex relaxation to variational inference and settles an   open question in continuous Bayesian inference: The Gaussian lower bound   relaxation is convex for a class of super-Gaussian potentials including the   Laplace and Bernoulli potentials.   Our algorithm reduces to the same computational primitives used for   sparse estimation methods, but requires Gaussian marginal variance esti-   mation as well. We show how the Lanczos algorithm from numerical math-   ematics can be employed to compute the latter.   We are interested in Bayesian experimental design, a powerful framework   for optimizing measurement architectures. We have applied our framework   to problems of magnetic resonance imaging design and reconstruction."}

It can be viewed online or downloaded as a zip file. As taught in Autumn Semester 2009/10 The aim of this short unit is to motivate students to understand why we might want to do proofs (why proofs are important and how they can help us) and to help students with some of the relatively routine aspects of doing proofs. In particular, the student will learn the following: * proofs can help you to really see why a result is true; * problems that are easy to state can be hard to solve (e.g. Fermat\u0027s Last Theorem); * sometimes statements which appear to be intuitively obvious may turn out to be false (e.g. Simpson\u0027s paradox); * the answer to a question will often depend crucially on the definitions you are working with; * how to start proofs; * how and when to use definitions and known results. The module is organised into three sections: Why; How (Part I); How (Part II) With practice, students should become fluent in these routine aspects of writing proofs, and this will allow them to focus instead on the more creative and interesting aspects of constructing proofs. A practice sheet is included after students have completed all three sections. Each section is suitable for a different level of audience, as described below: Suitable for: Foundation, undergraduate year one and undergraduate year two students Section 1: Why: Anyone with a knowledge of elementary algebra and prime numbers, as may be obtained by studying A level mathematics. (Foundation) Section 2: How (Part I) – Suitable for anyone with a knowledge of elementary algebra (including odd numbers, multiples of eight and the binomial theorem for expanding powers of (a+b)), and functions from the set of real numbers to itself (odd functions, even functions, multiplication and composition of functions). (Undergraduate year one) Section 3: How (Part II) – Requires some background knowledge of convergence and divergence of series of real numbers. A revision sheet is available. (Undergraduate year two) Dr Joel Feinstein, School of Mathematical Sciences Dr Joel Feinstein is an Associate Professor in Pure Mathematics at the University of Nottingham. After reading mathematics at Cambridge, he carried out research for his doctorate at Leeds. He held a postdoctoral position in Leeds for one year, and then spent two years as a lecturer at Maynooth (Ireland) before taking up a permanent position at Nottingham. His main research interest is in functional analysis, especially commutative Banach algebras. Dr Feinstein has published two case studies on his use of IT in the teaching of mathematics to undergraduates. In 2009, Dr Feinstein was awarded a University of Nottingham Lord Dearing teaching award for his popular and successful innovations in this area"}

In addition, some important discoveries have been made during the research of devastating pathogens such as Clostridium spp. Developed sensitive diagnostic methods allow us to track individual molecules in plant samples, seeds, food and drinking water, and different pathogenic microorganisms in the environment. Our expert knowledge is integrated into the widespread international activities and serves to the Ministry of Agriculture, forestry and food, environment and spatial planning, defense and health for addressing genetically modified organisms, existing and emerging plant diseases.  Our studies have revealed new defense mechanisms in plants under attack by viruses, bacteria, and Colorado potato beetle. A holistic view of plant disease development is accessed by the methods of systems biology.  Thousands of genes and hundreds of proteins are monitored at the transcriptome and proteome level, followed by data analysis and accurate interpretation. In order to better understand the complex network of cell, bacteria or whole plant molecular processes, we are applying bioinformatics tools, biostatistics analysis, data mining, visualization soft wares and mathematical modeling. The synthetic biology approaches for constructing new plants, viruses or viral proteins allow us to confirm new findings. By the electron microscopy we are opening the door into the exciting “nano world” of living beings. The results of the research team are published in the most prestigious journals, such as Nature Biotechnology and Nature structural \u0026 molecular biology. We are participating in the education process by teaching and publishing textbooks, some of them being translated in other languages. Members of the research team write popular articles and broadcast to bring science closer to the people. Our international cooperation is reflected in participation in four ongoing European projects. We also closely cooperate with research institutions and companies, responsible for development in Slovenia. Our research results are used for the improvement of drug production in cooperation with companies Lek Sandoz, Krka and in a newly established Competence research centre lead by company Acies Bio. Our methods have also been involved in the stem cell and cancer treatment research.    Biosensor research and research on viruses as therapeutics is carried out in the Centre of Excellency COBIK together with successful high-tech companies such as Bia Separations and Instrumentation technologies.

Structured learning means learning to predict outputs that have internal structure. For example, recognizing handwritten words is more accurate when the correlations between neighboring letters are used to reÞne predictions. This tutorial will provide a simple but thorough introduction to these new developments in machine learning that have great potential for many novel applications.  The tutorial will first explain what log-linear models are, with with concrete examples but also with mathematical generality. Next, feature-functions will be explained; these are the knowledge-representation technique underlying log-linear models. The tutorial will then present linear-chain CRFs, from the point of view that they are a special case of log-linear models. The Viterbi algorithm that makes inference tractable for linear-chain CRFs will be covered, followed by a discus- sion of inference for general CRFs. The presentation will continue with a general derivation of the gradient of log-linear models; this is the mathematical foundation of all log-linear training algorithms. Then, the tutorial will discuss two impor- tant special-case CRF training algorithms, one that is a variant of the perceptron method, and another one called contrastive divergence. Last but not least, the tu- torial will introduce publicly available software for training and using CRFs, and will explain a practical application of CRFs with hands-on detail."}

The current hot topic of large networks is also based on graph theory. Graph theory is one of the most recognized and established areas of Slovene mathematics, the expression »Slovene graph theory school« became standard in the area. Among the numerous areas of graph theory and related fields we put special emphasize on topological graph theory,  structure graph theory, spectral graph theory, metric graph theory, graph products, graph colorings, graph algorithms, computational geometry, combinatorial optimization, Tower of Hanoi problems as well as applications of these areas.     \tThe research group is composed from teams from the University of Ljubljana and the  University of Maribor, each having about one half of the members. The research programme is thus very important as it enables fruitful collaboration between the researchers from both universities. The programme in the present form was established in 2004 by merging the programme Graph products and metric graph theory consisting mostly of researchers from the University of Maribor and the programme Topological graph theory with members from the University of Ljubljana.    \tOur excellence can be proved with top-level publications, numerous invited talks at conferences and universities as well as with our editorial work in central, even prestigious, journals from the area of graph theory and more generally discrete mathematics. Another important achievement are four books published by leading scientific publishers. The first two, »Product graphs: Structure and Recognition«, published in 2000 by Wiley-Interscience and »Graphs on Surfaces« from 2001, published by Johns Hopkins University Press, are among the most cited works of Slovenian mathematics. They were follows with two more books published in 2008 and 2011 with A K Peters and CRC Press, respectively. "}

This brief video course is designed for engineers, scientists, medical personnel, managers, and others who work with lasers and/or fiberoptics, or who anticipate working with lasers and/or fiberoptics, yet have little or no background in laser or fiberoptic basics. The course focuses on fundamentals and emphasizes a physical intuitive interpretation of laser and fiberoptic phenomena and their applications. Because Prof. Ezekiel keeps mathematics to a minimum, the topics covered are easily understood, without the need for a strong technical background. Prof. Ezekiel uses plain language, graphic illustrations, and video demonstrations to explain the basic characteristics of lasers and fiberoptics.

First, from the fundamental inequality of a convex function, a family of divergence measures can be constructed, which specializes to the familiar Bregman divergence, Jenson difference, beta-divergence, and alpha-divergence, etc.   Second, the mixture parameter turns out to correspond to the alpha \u003c-\u003e -alpha duality in information geometry (which I call \\\"referential duality\\\", since it is related to the choice of a reference point for computing divergence).   Third, convex conjugate operation induces another kind of duality in information geometry, namely, that of biorthogonal coordinates and their transformation (which I call \\\"representational duality\\\", since it is related to the expression of geometric quantities, such as metric, affine connection, curvature, etc of the underlying manifold). Under this analysis, what is traditionally called \\\"+1/-1 duality\\\" and \\\"e/m duality\\\" in information geometry reflect two very different meanings of duality that are nevertheless intimately interwined for dually flat spaces."}

The first talk is a brief coverage of some basic statistical theory that I feel might be useful during the week. The topics included are: probability, likelihood inference, Bayesian inference and the concept of the bias variance tradeoff.      The second talk covers two main areas of statistics, namely linear modelling and exploratory multivariate analysis. Linear modelling has an elaborate set of procedures for determining which of the potential inputs should be included in a model for predicting an output. The inputs can be of any data type (categorical or numerical), as can the output to some extent. This sort of modelling has been used successfully for many years on what would be considered quite small sets of data. Some linear models are now being used on much larger problems, for example, in the construction of scorecards for deciding whether to approve somebody’s application for a credit card. This is the primary type of statistical model that would be used in scientific research. Exploratory multivariate analysis is a collection of techniques that are all based on the same sort of mathematical background (vectors/matrix algebra). They are also all intended to investigate the structure of observations that are vectors. Some of these techniques are being used on a massive scale in business; for example, hierarchical cluster analysis is used to build (offline) classifications of all the postal codes (each code represents about 16 houses) in a system such as Mosaic which is then used for targeting of marketing. The specific techniques covered are: principal components analysis; correspondence analysis; scaling; cluster analysis."}

I’ve met presidents, kings, prime ministers and many ordinary folks. I’ve done a lot of things. That was yesterday. What matters is today and tomorrow.” Now, says Fallon, is the time for all Americans to get down to business addressing the key crises confronting them. And he does mean ordinary Americans, not just the next president.    As a naval man with 45 years of experience dealing with conflicts all over the world, Fallon figures that the major challenges facing the nation will be at minimum “daunting,” but they are not beyond our collective capability. There’s the financial crisis; nuclear and other threats from Iran, North Korea and wide-ranging terror organizations; the competition for resources and the issue of climate change; and the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. All these issues are global, and increasingly interconnected, notes Fallon, and addressing them will require “close cooperation with other nations.”    The problem is that the U.S. has lost much credibility internationally in recent years, says Fallon, and so our leaders will have to reestablish the trust and confidence the rest of the world once had in our country. While top politicians can begin a process of diplomacy and cooperative engagements with other nations, Fallon thinks it’s equally or more important for ordinary Americans “to get our domestic house in order.” He’s of the opinion that the individual behaviors of Americans “have contributed to a general malaise,” and only by addressing these on an individual basis will our nation be able “to reestablish its prestige and influence for the betterment of a very interdependent world.”    Fallon focuses on the U.S. education system, which apart from world class universities like MIT, “wallows in underperformance … releasing millions of alleged graduates who can neither read nor write, understand math beyond elementary levels, find any place on a map….” Add to this “mediocrity” the fact that Americans feed their “self-indulgence in personal material goods” while starving such critical infrastructure as bridges and roads, which enable daily activities. Our critics rightly view us as “increasingly self-centered and heedless of the interests of others,” notes Fallon. It’s time to set our priorities straight. The U.S. has the “human capital, traditional values and the immense resources to take on and fix any of these problems.” What remains is the “willingness to do the job. Let’s get going,” he concludes."}

Here we propose an information-theoretic formalization of bounded rational decision-making where decision-makers trade off expected utility and information processing costs. As a result, the decision-making problem can be rephrased in terms of well-known concepts from thermodynamics and statistical physics, such that the same exponential family distributions that govern statistical ensembles can be used to describe the stochastic choice behavior of bounded decision-makers. This framework does not only explain some well-known experimental deviations from expected utility theory, but also reproduces psychophysical choice pattern captured by diffusion-to-bound models. Furthermore, this framework allows rederiving a number of decision-making schemes including risk-sensitive and robust (minimax) decision-making as well as more recent approximately optimal schemes that are based on the relative entropy. In the limit when resource costs are ignored, the maximum expected utility principle is recovered. Since most of the mathematical machinery can be borrowed from statistical physics, the main contribution is to show how a thermodynamic model of bounded rationality can provide a unified view of diverse decision-making phenomena and control schemes."}

The age-old awe that man has had for the heavens has driven almost all aspects of human culture and knowledge and resulted in technologies with generally positive, though occasionally negative effect. Arguably the most positive have taken place since Galileo recognized that the phases of Venus provided the evidence that confirmed the Copernican heliocentric system and cemented his position firmly as the “Father of Science”. From this moment on we had, at long last, a straightforward philosophical construct and language which enabled mankind to determine what is and is not “True”. Particularly important truths have resulted from the curiosity that humans have had for a detailed understanding of the way Universe works. This led to the development of astrophysics and the associated technologies that have been spun-off. Not least of these has been the telescope – from Galileo’s beautiful original design to the fantastic satellite-born devices put up by NASA. These have not only enabled us to observe the planets and stars more clearly but we have been able to see to the very edge of the Universe and make a plethora of discoveries about all aspects of the Universe from the occupants of the space between stars to the processes occurring deep inside stars. Perhaps the most fundamental advance based on space observations led to the development of Classical Mechanics in order to understand the motions of the planets and comets and concommitantly the development Calculus, one of the greatest of Mathematical achievements. As Quantum Mechanics developed along with Spectroscopy it was inevitable that we should start to study the atomic and molecular composition of heavenly bodies - first hot stars as well as cool comets. With the development of radiotelescopes, the very cold interstellar medium was found to be a veritable Pandora\u0027s Box, full to the brim with fascinating and exotic molecules, dust particles and also some highly puzzling material responsible for some as yet unidentified spectroscopic features. These latter are known as the Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) first observed in the 1920s.    Particularly fascinating, curious and crucial has been the role that the element carbon has played in almost every aspect of the development of our understanding of both the physical and natural sciences. The fact that the element is at all abundant is due to a curious set of coincidences involving its nucleosynthesis from helium in stars. If one furthermore adds into the overall carbon equation its uniquely profuse chemistry, ie Organic Chemistry, it is hard to conceive that life could be based on any other element. The most recent big surprise that the element had up its sleeve was the existence of C60, Buckminsterfullerene, the third well-defined form of carbon. The discovery was made serendipitously in 1985 during laboratory experiments which attempted to explain the chemical synthesis of some unusually long linear carbon chain molecules detected in the interstellar medium in the 1970’s. A second aim of these experiments involved curiosity as to whether the carriers of the DIBs might be long linear carbon chains. Interestingly the extraction of C60 in 1990 by Kraetschmer and Huffman resulted from experiments aimed at understanding another mysterious feature known as the 217nm hump and conjectured to also involve carbon – perhaps carbonaceous dust particles. The fact that this third, well-defined, form of carbon had been hiding in the shadows since time immemorial brings to mind the mysterious character lurking in the dark streets of Vienna, made famous by Orson Welles in the classic movie “The Third Man”. In fact we now know that the molecule forms fleetingly within sooting flames but is immediately destroyed as it passes through the flame barrier into an oxygen atmosphere. On the basis of such revelations the suggestion that C60 might exist in space and be responsible for the DIBs (Kroto \u0026 Jura) seemed an as good, if not a better, possibility than most other ideas that had heretofore been proposed. Especially compelling support for the idea that C60 existed in space lay in the fact that the original discovery was made serendipitously during laboratory experiments designed to simulate the atmospheric conditions in cool red giant carbon stars. This conjecture has just been confirmed by Cami et al who have found infra red bands in the spectra obtained by NASA’s Spitzer satellite telescope. The discovery also makes some recent work here at FSU on endohedral fullerenes, in which atoms are trapped inside the carbon cage, extremely relevant to certain anomalous isotope ratios observed in meteorites, in particular carbonaceous chondrites. This is yet another example of the remarkably synergistic relationship between terrestrial and space science. In these difficult times it lends useful support for the fundamental value of \\\"Blue Skies\\\" or perhaps more accurately “Black Skies” cross-disciplinary research. All these results taken together suggest that the 90 year-old mystery of the carrier of the DIBs might be close to being resolved at long last."}

He points out that the entire process of examining how to strengthen this nation’s position in the global economy was contrary to the slow and deliberate pace of Academy members. By request of Congress, they had to arrive at a strategy with concrete steps in 90 days, which “almost violates the second law of thermodynamics,” says Whitesides. The notion was to “get a group of smart people together and have them come up with good ideas.”    This assembly of some of the nation’s top scientists, engineers and industry leaders found that the U.S. science and technology establishment has eroded, while other nations are making rapid advances in these areas. Since “capitalism dictates that corporations get the best bang for the buck,” as Whitesides says, industries will increasingly look outside the U.S. for high tech development and enterprise. This finding has grabbed the attention of Washington politicians, says Whitesides, who are keenly interested in American jobs.    Among the study’s conclusions: The U.S. must renew its commitment to education, research and innovation to ensure work for coming generations; we need to avoid being complacent that the U.S. will remain competitive and preeminent in science and technology; and actions are required not only of federal, state and local governments, but of each American family.    The recommendations are captured in what Whitesides describes as “catchy phrases:” 10 Thousand Teachers, 10 Million Minds; Sowing the Seeds; Best and Brightest; Incentives for Innovation. Translated, these recommendations involve recruiting 10 thousand able people to teach K-12 math and science; pumping money into long-term basic research; increasing the numbers of U.S. citizens earning science, engineering and math degrees and making it easier for foreign students to study here; and making the U.S. the premiere place for innovation in terms of tax policy, intellectual property protection and other incentives.    The report has engendered broad bipartisan and White House support--“Everyone is for it,” says Whitesides, but the question of how to pay for all the study’s recommendations nags. The Office of Management and Budget says it doesn’t have the money. And one central idea of an advanced research project centered on energy is “clouded by complexities.” Whitesides predicts years of discussion in Washington."}

Janez Dolinšek. Smart materials possess superior structural, physical, chemical and mechanical properties that are not present in conventional materials. An example is a combination of an electrical conductor with a thermal insulator and a combination of hardness, elasticity and anomalously low friction coefficient. Some smart materials exhibit thermal memory phenomenon, enabling thermal inscription of a byte of digital information by pure thermal manipulation of the material, in the absence of an external electric, magnetic or electromagnetic field. In materials know as magnetoelectrics, electrical and magnetic properties are coupled, so that one is able to control their magnetic properties by an external electric field and vice versa. The research is directed towards the synthesis, characterization and understanding the physical properties at the atomistic level of materials from the families of quasicrystals, complex metallic alloys, metallic glasses, multiferroic materials, nanomaterials and nanocomposites, frustrated magnetic systems, ferroelectric thin films, liquid crystals, carbon-based fullerene derivatives, heavy-fermion conductors, unconventional superconductors and materials with giant electrocaloric and thermoelastic response. We are using experimental methods of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance, measurements of the electrical conductivity, thermoelectric power, Hall coefficient, thermal conductivity and specific heat, frequency-dependent high-resolution calorimetry, linear and nonlinear dielectric spectroscopy and magnetic measurements. An important scientific breakthrough of our group was the introduction of a novel concept of digital data storage in materials known as complex metallic alloys, where we were able to store arbitrary ASCII characters that present text in computers by pure thermal manipulation. The discovery shows potential to open a new field of digital information technology, called the thermal computing, where mathematical operations are performed by pure thermal manipulation of the material, in the absence of an electric or a magnetic field.

Game Theory has emerged as a branch of mathematics and is still quite mathematical. Our emphasis will be on the conceptual analysis, keeping the level of math to a minimum, especially at a level that should be quite acceptable to the average MIT student. Yet bear in mind that this still implies that you should be at ease with basic probability theory and calculus, and more importantly, you should be used to thinking in mathematical terms.

The process of integrating ICT in education is rarely a simple and linear one - overlaps are often noted, with some elements operating in parallel, in partnership and cyclically. The sequence of steps varies from one activity or situation to the next and must take context into account in order to be effective. The process is thus necessarily incremental and relies on clearly defined objectives to succeed in improving the efficiency of ICT use in education. This document presents major themes to assist educators in better integrating ICT with their teaching, and particularly allowing them to offer higher quality distance education programs to Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics students. An introduction to the theories and principals of ICT integration is presented within six themes, and further developed into seven specific learning objectives, which can be according to the specific subject of the program."}

Option B (18.100B) is more demanding and for students with more mathematical maturity; it places more emphasis from the beginning on point-set topology and n-space, whereas Option A is concerned primarily with analysis on the real line, saving for the last weeks work in 2-space (the plane) and its point-set topology.

It was certainly not introduced in the context of X-ray tomography  or anything else. It was introduced for purely mathematical reasons, for interesting  geometric reasons. The idea was to sort of study the geometry of a region by knowing  integrals of sections through it just as a purely mathematical question. I don’t think there  were any practical implications that were anticipated or attempted certainly at the time it  was introduced. So our question is – so you know all these values. All right? You know  all these values, and the question is can you invert the transform? Can you find mu, given  that you know all the values of its transform? ...

These processes usually involve group decision  making by means of an experts’ committee. In this paper a  mathematical framework based on the qualitative model of  the absolute orders of magnitude is considered. The entropy  of a qualitatively described system is defined in this framework.  On the one hand, this enables us to measure the amount  of information provided by each evaluator and, on the other  hand, the coherence of the evaluation committee. The new  approach is capable of managing situations where the assessment  given by experts involves different levels of precision.  The use of the proposed measures within an automatic system  for group decision making will contribute towards avoiding  the potential subjectivity caused by conflicts of interests  of the evaluators in the group."}

Over four remarkable decades, UCI has become internationally recognized for efforts that are improving lives through research and discovery, fostering excellence in scholarship and teaching, and engaging and enriching the community.    UCI is among the fastest-growing campuses in the UC system. Increasingly a first-choice campus for students, UCI attracts record numbers of undergraduate applications each year and admits freshmen with highly competitive academic profiles. UCI is a center for quality education and is consistently ranked among the nation’s best universities. Achievements in the sciences, arts, humanities, medicine, and management have garnered top 50 national rankings for more than 40 academic programs. Three UCI researchers have won Nobel Prizes—two in chemistry and one in physics.    The University launched its OpenCourseWare initiative in November 2006. As the first West Coast university and UC campus to join the OpenCourseWare Consortium (OCWC), our OCW project is growing rapidly with the addition of nearly10 new courses every month. Many of our OCW offerings are directed at working adults seeking continuing education, with the option to enroll in instructor-led, for-credit courses, related to the OCW content. Our OCW initiative is supported partly by funding from extra-mural sponsors like the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation—funding that has allowed for the development of OCW created specifically or targeted audiences such as California public school teachers seeking help in passing state examinations for single-subject science and mathematics credentials. In addition, our OCW Web site also provides students and self learners around the globe with access to UCI-faculty created undergraduate and graduate courses that are currently being taught to matriculated UCI students.

In this talk, I introduce the idea of a “cautious oracle” as a more human version of Turing’s oracles. Nevertheless, I show that even this fails to capture the essence of the full capabilities of our understanding.    I raise the issue of possible physical processes that would appear to be needed in order to circumvent these Gödel-type restrictions.

Statistical models of such systems can give descriptions of global  relational features, characterize local network structure, and provide  predictions for missing or future relational data.    Latent variable models are a popular tool for describing network  and relational patterns. Many of these models are based on well-known  matrix decomposition methods, and thus have a rich mathematical framework  upon which to build. Additionally, the parameters in these models are  easy to interpret: Roughly speaking, a latent variable model posits that  the relationship between two nodes is a function of observed and  unobserved (latent) characteristics, potentially in addition to contextual  factors.    In this tutorial I give an introduction to latent variable models for  relational and network data. I first provide a mathematical justification  for a general latent factor model based on exchangeability considerations.  I then describe and illustrate several latent variable models in the context  of the statistical analysis of several network datasets. I also compare  several such models in terms of what network features they can, and cannot,  represent.    A particularly flexible class of models are the \\\"latent factor\\\" models,  based on singular value and eigen-decompositions of a relational matrix.  These models generalize in a natural way to accommodate more complicated  relational data, such as  datasets that are described by multiway arrays, such as a network measured over time or the measurement of several relational variables on a common nodeset.  I will close the tutorial by showing how tools from multiway data analysis  (such as the higher order SVD and PARAFAC decomposition) can be used  to build statistical models of multiway networks and relational data."}

First, I will present two simple and explicit procedures for testing homogeneity of two independent multivariate samples of size $n$. The nonparametric tests are based on the statistic $T_n$, which is the $L_1$ distance between  the two empirical distributions restricted to a finite partition. Both tests reject the null hypothesis of homogeneity if $T_n$ becomes large, i.e., if $T_n$ exceeds a threshold. I will first discuss Chernoff-type large deviation properties of $T_n$. This results in a distribution-free strong consistent test of homogeneity. Then the asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic is obtained, leading to an asymptotically $alpha$-level test procedure.    In the second part, I will consider the problem of selecting an unknown multivariate density $f$ belonging to a set of densities ${cal F}_{k^*}$ of finite associated Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, where the complexity $k^*$ is unknown, and $mathcal F_k subset mathcal F_{k+1}$ for all $k$. Given an i.i.d. sample of size $n$ drawn from $f$, I will show how the statistic $T_n$ can be used to build an estimate $hat f_{K_n}$ yielding almost sure convergence of the estimated complexity $K_n$ to the true but unknown $k^*$, and with the property $mathbf E {int|hat f_{K_n}-f|}\u003dmbox{O}(1/sqrt{n})$.

Motion Synthesis and Control Learning for (Un)Knotting Deformable Linear Objects","tname":"-","topicName":"-","type":"-","categoryName":"-","desc":"This research deals with motion planning and control for Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs).  It is still a complex task to get a robot manipulate a rope or cloth. To realise this vision of getting a robot to handle dexterous objects, we have taken the simplest object i.e. a DLO for our study purpose. The operations performed on the DLO are knot-(un)tying. The DLO is thus parameterised as a Knot and we make the DLO (un)tied into various knot types. The mathematical branch of Knot Theory is extensively used here to realise the Knots. The configuration space that the Knot can move is computed by the Knot Energy. We use the Minimum Distance Knot energy here. With this, we create a hierarchical graph structure with nodes corresponding to optimal knot configurations obtained by optimising this Knot energy functional. Thus by navigating this graph, we are able to (un)tie various knots. The study looks into 3 simple and 2 complex knot types. Motion control while (un)tying is also brought about using the SARSA(ÃŽÂ») [Reinforcement Learning] algorithm. The motion planner is resilient to perturbations as well. Thus by devising Knot Energy together with SARSA(ÃŽÂ»), we have built a multi-scale, reactive knot (un)tying motion planner. Results show that our method is incredibly  faster than normal Probabilistic and feedback control methods. For more, please refer to my MSc thesis titled \u0027Multi-scale, Reactive Motion Planning with Deformable Linear Objects\u0027 at [[http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/publications/thesis/online/IM080596.pdf]] or for the complete version including Motion control at [[http://www.mediafire.com/file/dozd2zm3mam/MSc]] thesis - SARSA and Knot energy version.pdf."}

She describes our current education system as rooted in the 19th century, and failing to provide students with the tools to participate in a global, “conceptual economy.” Learning must engender innovation -- what Wince-Smith calls “I to the 5th power: the intersection of imagination, insight, ingenuity, invention and impact.”    At Tufts University, says Lawrence Bacow, “We imbed engineering in liberal arts,” generating interaction between arts and sciences students and engineering faculty and students. Among liberal arts students, this fuels both technological literacy and such an interest in engineering that there’s been a trend-reversing net migration from arts and sciences to engineering. “By not isolating arts and science students in an engineering ghetto, we’ve created a more literate engineer,” says Bacow.    Richard Lampman says Hewlett Packard looks to hire “a whole person who needs to be able to interact on a broader basis…who can be an entrepreneur, work in global cross-cultural teams.” For him, the, the principal consideration in education “is how to get students capable of doing more than just solving problems -- that’s table stakes. To go beyond that, they need a lot more.”    To find developers for Microsoft, Rick Rashid travels increasingly to India, China and Europe. He can’t meet the demand in the U.S. “for people who are mentally agile, can solve problems under pressure and can work with other people.” He’s witnessing an enormous drop off in relevant graduates nationwide, with a disproportionate loss of women and minorities. “If you step back broadly and look at engineering, you can be very concerned, but look just at my area, computer science, and it’s reasonable to start thinking about panicking,” says Rashid.    Vernon Ehlers says his role on the panel “is to represent the ignorant people of this country” -- not the children who know they want to be engineers, but the “passionless kids” who don’t get the basic principles of math and science. As someone who grew up in a town of 800 with no early college ambitions, Ehlers understands these kids. He says, “If we’re serious about meeting the manpower needs of the nation, we literally have to start with preschool.” He also advises “teaching teachers to be excited about math and science, so they can convey this to their kids.    Diane Jones didn’t know what a Ph.D. was until college. Getting a science education was a “pretty difficult” path for her, and she learned that her field was elitist. That’s one reason she counsels “looking for talent in new places,” like the community colleges where she’s taught. You’ll find smart kids there, she says, and it’s where to head “if you really want to go after women and minorities.” She also sees engineering, especially IT, as the way up for first generation students in this country."}

Our approach was inspired by global consistency measures that directly evaluate the similarity between a given distribution and the distribution of the resulting segmentation, which were recently proposed in order to overcome the limitations of traditional pixelwise (local) consistency measures. The main feature of our proposal is that it uses two (foreground and background) input distributions, which increases the robustness compared to previous studies. To achieve this, we formulated a new mathematical model that describes the consistencies between the two input distributions and the segmentation, in which weighting parameters for the two distribution matching terms are set to be approximately proportional to the size of the foreground and background areas. We call this dual distribution matching (DDM). We also derived an optimization method that uses graph cuts. Experimental results that show the effectiveness of our method and comparisons between local and global consistency measures are presented. "}

Since it is a new formalism for handling uncertainty in DL ontologies, no such methodology has been proposed. There are no sufficiently large probabilistic ontologies to be used as test suites. In addition, since the reasoning services in P-  ${ensuremath{mathcal{SHIQ}}(D)}$ are mostly query oriented, there is no single problem (like classification or realization in classical DL) that could be an obvious candidate for benchmarking. All these issues make it hard to evaluate the performance of reasoners, reveal the complexity bottlenecks and assess the value of optimization strategies. This paper addresses these important problems by making the following contributions: First, it describes a probabilistic ontology that has been developed for the real-life domain of breast cancer which poses significant challenges for the state-of-art P-  ${ensuremath{mathcal{SHIQ}}(D)}$ reasoners. Second, it explains a systematic approach to generating a series of probabilistic reasoning problems that enable evaluation of the reasoning performance and shed light on what makes reasoning in P-  ${ensuremath{mathcal{SHIQ}}(D)}$ hard in practice. Finally, the paper presents an optimized algorithm for the non-monotonic entailment. Its positive impact on performance is demonstrated using our evaluation methodology."}

Sakas provides a swift conceptual survey of modeling parameter-setting, from Chomsky, through Yang and Lightfoot. In “the spirit of Pinker,” Sakas believes that any computational model of a feasible learner must be compatible with the psychological resources of a human child. So Sakas’s lab tries to zero in on “what is needed in the way of psycho-computational resources in a learner to converge on the target grammar on the basis of a limited sample of sentences.” The lab has created “a large, artificial but linguistically motivated domain of parameterized languages for evaluating learning models,” with more than 1.6 million parsed sentences. Sakas and his colleagues compare the efficiencies of different parameter-setting models, attempt to solve such modeling problems as noise and over-generalization, as well as evaluate richness of the stimulus claims.  Underlying this work – “the whole parameter setting enterprise” -- says Sakas, is the effort “to limit the resources to what can reasonably be attributed to young children,” so as to reduce the complexity of innate knowledge -- generally limit the amount and complexity of input and processing of each sentence. The sticky problem remains of finding a “psycho-computationally palatable way” of modeling a process of fitting grammar to multiple sentences.  “We feel alone in this endeavor,” says Sakas. While there’s lots of interesting recent work on modeling syntax acquisition, mathematical, and statistical/probabilistic learning, “we haven’t been able to take it into our models, because it doesn’t seem to be concerned with resource limits.” The ideal learner other linguists discuss “is not a learner concerned with resource issues.” Sakas asks if “this work is intended to mirror psychological reality.” He notes, “The effective richness of the stimulus for a child language learner depends on the child’s non-ideal capacity to extract information from heard utterances.” The point is to model what a child really does with the linguistic input available to her. Sakas concludes with a question: “Is there anyone out there trying to solve the psychological resource problem?"}

One approach for doing  so is to draw a full diagram of the network, since this can, if clearly drawn,  contain all of the recorded information. However, an unambiguous diagram is  only feasible for very small networks, in which case it is unlikely that the mathematical  abstraction will return any surprising results. To learn about a network  of any significant size it is therefore necessary to characterise it by summary  descriptions, which we will refer to as metrics.    We introduce a more systematic framework, in the form of a matrix whose rows  correspond to networks, and columns to metrics; we term this the data matrix.  Each element of the data matrix contains the value of one metric as applied to  one network. In this paper we show that this framework enables the systematic  comparison of networks and metrics, and demonstrate its utility in the objective  selection of metrics for a given purpose; in model fitting; in the analysis of  evolving networks; and to determine the robustness of metrics to variations in  network size, network damage and sampling effects."}

The connection between the two different disciplines, says Williams, was “something new in history.” Scientific understanding had previously been “aristocratic, elitist, intellectual, and…speculative.” Technology had been “more lower class, empirical and action-oriented.” MIT’s approach was to meld engineering with pure science, and then, after World War 2, to broaden engineering by connecting with the social sciences. Today, MIT has become a “pioneer in deep ‘multidisciplinarity’,” says Williams, enabled to address key human problems involving science, technology and society.    \\\"Marine Microbes: Tiny Cells, Global Impact\\\"  Please don’t confuse Penny Chisholm’s beloved Prochlorococcus, (a marine microbe) with your run of the mill bacterium, or worse, with some dreaded pathogen. This species of phytoplankton, discovered in 1985, turns out to be a biological superstar. As Chisholm says, “My organism is extremely important.” Prochlorococcus, existing in abundance in much of the world’s oceans, is a remarkable biological pump. It and fellow phytoplankton suck up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and engage in “almost as much photosynthesis as trees and plants on land,” says Chisholm. We must begin to look at the sea “as teaming with information,” remarks Chisholm, with microbes “shaping the composition of the atmosphere, seawater and habitability of the earth itself.”    “Tiny Crystals: The Path From Science to Technology\\\"  Trial and error played a large role in the evolution of Moungi Bawendi’s field, which emerged from research in different disciplines: the search for solar energy during the energy crisis of the 1970s; making smaller semiconductors; constructing lasers for products like CD players. Physical chemists, manipulating tiny particles in different solutions, saw them grow “like snowflakes” into different shapes, says Bawendi. Some of these particles emitted different colors of light. Researchers developed fluorescent microspheres, particles made out of silica, that emit specific colors. Today these tiny balls can be used to image blood flow to detect leaks in tumor walls. Apply a current and the balls go in different directions. “These are the kinds of discoveries that grad students stumble on if they work late at night,” says Bawendi. Nanocrystal quantum dot lasers make “beautiful colors for computers,” and biologists can use these quantum dots for color coding DNA chains in gene assays and possibly for biomedical imaging in living organisms.    “Big Iron to Little Silicon”  After a poetic tribute to his colleagues, Alex Slocum performs what he calls “a high speed download.” He speaks of the different paths to invention, from sitting at a CAD station, to heading off for a mountain hike. He sketches the idea of a “nanotube spinneret, analogous to a showerhead.” Slocum’s goal “is to wear the first Hawaiian shirt made from nanotubes.” Slocum’s work is living proof of his motto: “Science doesn’t have to be boring.” He designs “stuff from silicon wafers to bottles,” to lighter wind turbines and nodes for pool noodles. Slocum views the design process as a way to have fun with math—an approach he’d dearly like to promulgate. He’s pursuing an educational system for grade schools that aims to teach “systematic thinking and the scientific method” using rhymes, bath songs and computer animations."}

Articles about Massively Open Online Classes (MOOCs) had been rocking the academic world (at least gently), and it seemed that your writer had scarcely experimented with teaching methods. Particularly compelling was the fact that there already had been some successes reported with computer programming classes in the online format, especially as MOOCs. Finite Element Methods, with the centrality that computer programming has to the teaching of this topic, seemed an obvious candidate for experimentation in the online format. From there to the video lectures that you are about to view took nearly a year. I first had to take a detour through another subject, Continuum Physics, for which video lectures also are available, and whose recording in this format served as a trial run for the present series of lectures on Finite Element Methods.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere they are then, about 50 hours of lectures covering the material I normally teach in an introductory graduate class at University of Michigan. The treatment is mathematical, which is natural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus. It is not formal, however, because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into a competent developer of finite element code. We do spend time in rudimentary functional analysis, and variational calculus, but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for the methods, which in turn explains why they work so well. Much of the success of the Finite Element Method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematical foundation, and this needs to be appreciated, even if only in the elementary manner presented here. A background in PDEs and, more importantly, linear algebra, is assumed, although the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp variable\u003d\\\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/variable#\\\"\u003eThe development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations (PDEs): elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic. At each stage, however, we make numerous connections to the physical phenomena represented by the PDEs. For clarity we begin with elliptic PDEs in one dimension (linearized elasticity, steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion). We then move on to three dimensional elliptic PDEs in scalar unknowns (heat conduction and mass diffusion), before ending the treatment of elliptic PDEs with three dimensional problems in vector unknowns (linearized elasticity). Parabolic PDEs in three dimensions come next (unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion), and the lectures end with hyperbolic PDEs in three dimensions (linear elastodynamics). Interspersed among the lectures are responses to questions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who followed the lectures live. At suitable points in the lectures, we interrupt the mathematical development to lay out the code framework, which is entirely open source, and C++ based.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt is hoped that these lectures on Finite Element Methods will complement the series on Continuum Physics to provide a point of departure from which the seasoned researcher or advanced graduate student can embark on work in (continuum) computational physics.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp variable\u003d\\\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/variable#\\\"\u003eThere are a number of people that I need to thank: Shiva Rudraraju and Greg Teichert for their work on the coding framework, Tim O\u0027Brien for organizing the recordings, Walter Lin and Alex Hancook for their camera work and post-production editing, and Scott Mahler for making the studios available.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp variable\u003d\\\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/variable#\\\"\u003eKrishna Garikipati\u003cbr /\u003e \tAnn Arbor, December 2013\u003c/p\u003e \u003cfieldset class\u003d\\\"fieldgroup group-instructor\\\"\u003e\u003clegend\u003eInstructor\u003c/legend\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\\\"field field-type-nodereference field-field-course-instructor\\\"\u003e       \u003cdiv class\u003d\\\"field-label\\\"\u003eCourse Instructor:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e     \u003cdiv class\u003d\\\"field-items\\\"\u003e             \u003cdiv class\u003d\\\"field-item odd\\\"\u003e                     \u003ca href\u003d\\\"http://open.umich.edu/node/7937\\\"\u003eKrishna Garikipati\u003c/a\u003e        \u003c/div\u003e         \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/fieldset\u003e"}

If he time-traveled like Dr. Who, he would be stunned to find his words on a university syllabus. However, he would not be surprised at the way we will be using those words in this class, because the study of rhetoric was essential to all education in his day. At Oxford, William Gager argued that drama allowed undergraduates \u0026quot;to try their voices and confirm their memories, and to frame their speech and conform it to convenient action\u0026quot;: in other words, drama was useful. Shakespeare\u0027s fellow playwright Thomas Heywood similarly recalled: In the time of my residence in Cambridge, I have seen Tragedies, Comedies, Histories, Pastorals and Shows, publicly acted\u0026hellip;: this is held necessary for the emboldening of their Junior scholars, to arm them with audacity, against they come to be employed in any public exercise, as in the reading of Dialectic, Rhetoric, Ethic, Mathematic, the Physic, or Metaphysic Lectures. Such practice made a student able to \u0026quot;frame a sufficient argument to prove his questions, or defend any axioma, to distinguish of any Dilemma and be able to moderate in any Argumentation whatsoever\u0026quot; (Apology for Actors, 1612). In this class, we will use Shakespeare\u0027s own words to arm you \u0026quot;with audacity\u0026quot; and a similar ability to make logical, compelling arguments, in speech and in writing. Shakespeare used his ears and eyes to learn the craft of telling stories to the public in the popular form of theater. He also published two long narrative poems, which he dedicated to an aristocrat, and wrote sonnets to share \u0026quot;among his private friends\u0026quot; (so wrote Francis Meres in his Palladis Tamia, 1598). Varying his style to suit different audiences and occasions, and borrowing copiously from what he read, Shakespeare nevertheless found a voice all his own\u0026ndash;so much so that his words are now, as his fellow playwright Ben Jonson foretold, \u0026quot;not of an age, but for all time.\u0026quot;  Reading, listening, analyzing, appreciating, criticizing, remembering: we will engage with these words in many ways, and will see how words can become ideas, habits of thought, indicators of emotion, and a means to transform the world."}

DNA instability at some microsatellites is the underlying genetic defect in a number of human diseases including myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). New quantitative data, collected by single molecule analysis of repeat length in blood cells from 145 DM1 patients reveals the extent and nature of the genetic variation within and between patients (Morales, PhD thesis, 2006). This dataset of thousands of de novo mutations provides a unique opportunity to examine the underlying mechanism of mutation, which is thought to be a universal biological process that is simply amplified in the disease case. We are developing discrete mathematical models and stochastic simulation techniques that capture key features of the mutation mechanism underlying repeat length evolution. We derive analytical expressions for the length distribution of an adapted birth and death process and employ Bayesian techniques to calibrate our models against the biological data and test model hypotheses. Our work aims to improve prognostic information for patients, as well as providing a deeper understanding of the underlying biological process. In particular we will provide evidence that a previous model (Kaplan et al., 2007) can be improved by introducing a non-zero contraction rate."}

A general mathematical theory of causation which supports human causal intuitions is thus of utmost importance for formalizing and perhaps one day automating scientific inquiry. This tutorial will describe one such theory of causation, based on graphical models. The tutorial will consist of two parts.    The first part will introduce graphical causal models as vehicles for expressing causal assumptions, and interventions as an operation formalizing the notions of causal effects and counterfactuals. Examples of using this framework to pose and answer practical causal questions in public health will be given. The first part will conclude by giving a general algorithm for identifying causal effects from observational studies, and showing how the so called post-truncation independence constraints in latent variable graphical models can be given an interpretation in terms of such effects.    The second part will discuss a recursive factorization (r-factorization) for latent variable graphical models, and show how post-truncation constraints which do not make an appearance in directed acyclic graph (DAG) models are captured by this factorization. A causal interpretation of this factorization will be given. The second part will conclude by giving some notable examples of such models, including testably distinct models which agree on all conditional independences, and models with a graph fully specified by a single post-truncation independence."}

A dynamic network of subcellular compartments, termed endosomes, actively controls signal propagation, amplitude and timing by uptake and transport of membrane-associated signaling molecules. The small GTPase Rab5 is the central organizer of the protein machinery that assembles on early endosomes, providing a unique identity to the compartment that controls cargo sorting, transport and signaling potential. We interlink experimental and computational approaches to (I) unravel the design principles underlying the function and regulation of the endocytic pathway and to (II) understand the molecular links that govern endosomal control of signaling events. Our approach takes into account both newly identified Rab5 effectors as well as the perspective of an on-going genome-wide RNAi screening for novel endocytic transport regulators. We develop and analyze a mathematical core model of the kinetic interactions between the endosomal organizers Rab4, Rab5 and Rab7. The values of the model parameters are estimated from literature and FRAP experiments. Simulations and bifurcation analysis of the model reveal bistable behavior of Rab5 versus Rab7 dominance that reproduces the controled and robust transition from early to late endosomal compartments as observed by means of computational motion tracking of individual endosomes in fluorescence live cell imaging data.The modeled Rab5 module serves as a blueprint for the sequential assembly of the endocytic pathway, therewith contributing an important spatial aspect to systems biology. Our kinetic model explains the experimentally observed transitions between endosomal compartments as the result of cargo-regulated competition between Rab proteins."}

Mathematical models of network motifs are already developed and experimentally validated. We analyze the stability of previously validated mathematical models of network motifs against the fluctuations in their associated biochemical reaction rates and find that all of these elementary functional modules are stable against any perturbation in their rates of reaction. In gene regulatory networks the motifs are connected to each other in a directed acyclic manner. Any large assembly of stable and robust motifs connected with each other in a directed acyclic manner exhibits stable and robust dynamics. All the motifs except those having feedback loops in their structure preserve certain dynamic properties when embedded within large operational networks. Our study also suggests that evolutionary mechanisms selected stable and robust functional modules with which to build regulatory networks in order to ensure stability and reliability on a larger scale instead of finding the simplest canonical representation with which to serve the same purpose."}

Accuracy requirements of measurements and error propagation: Related to a problem the required accuracy of measurements and the consequences for accuracy in the final result are discussed. Different types of errors are handled. Propagation of errors; for dependent and independent measurements, from mathematical relations and regression is demonstrated. Recapitulated is the theory of regression and correlation.  Interpretation of measurements, data completion: By standard statistical methods screening of measured data is performed; double mass analysis, residual mass, simple rainfall-runoff modelling. Detection of trends; split record tests, Spearman rank tests. Methods to fill data gaps and do filtering on data series for noise reduction.  Methods of hydrological measurements and measuring equipment: To determine quantitatively the most important elements in the hydrological cycle an overview is presented of most common hydrological measurements, measuring equipment and indirect determination methods i.e. for precipitation, evaporation, transpiration, river discharge and groundwater tables. Use, purpose and measurement techniques for tracers in hydrology is discussed. Advantages and disadvantages and specific condition/application of methods are discussed. Equipment is demonstrated and discussed.  Areal distributed observation: Areal interpolation techniques of point observations: inverse distance, Thiessen, contouring, Kriging. Comparison of interpolation techniques and estimation of errors. Correlation analysis of areal distributed observation of rainfall.  Design of measuring networks: Based on correlation characteristics from point measurements (e.g. rainfall stations) and accuracy requirements the design of a network of stations is demonstrated.  Computer Exercise: Theories on processing and screening of data are applied with data from actual river catchments. Exercises on stage-discharge relations and discharge measurements, hydrograph seperation and age dating from tracer observations. Evaporation from energy balance. Areal interpolation.   Study Goals After having studied the lecture material and attended the lectures the following is expected:  1.

King ticks off areas where the EC can be viewed alternatively: for instance, does it encourage healthy, broad-based campaigning and widespread voting, or promote targeted campaigning, and widespread voter fraud? Well acquainted with congressmen, King worries about the tension between short-term concerns (getting re-elected), and long-term interests. He believes that with the Electoral College, “you at least tip toward caring about winning multiple states…and the more states you try to win, the more candidates for office look to the long term and national best interest.”    Arnold Barnett offers a “pragmatic compromise” between a popular vote and the current Electoral College system, a potential cure for the current “funhouse mirror” of election politics based on weighted averages. Hold elections in individual states, and determine each candidate’s percentage. Says Barnett: “Each candidate’s national vote share would be a weighted average of vote shares in individual states. The weight of each state would be proportional to its share of electoral votes (i.e., the number of members of Congress).” The candidate with the highest weighted vote share would become president. Advantages of this system, says Barnett, include increasing the power of small states, and making currently irrelevant big states like New York relevant again. It would eliminate the worst consequences of winner take all (“Poster child: Florida 2000”); and there would be no danger of an election heading for the House of Representatives “where the president would be chosen under Strange Rules.”    Under the current system, not everyone has a say in presidential elections, Alexander Belenky believes, because a candidate with a very small percentage of the popular vote can actually become president. The Founding Fathers came up with a compromise to resolve problems in their day, and they “might be surprised to learn we still have this system.” Belenky suggests considering the will of the nation as a whole and the will of the states and DC as equal members of the Union as two decisive factors in determining the election outcome while retaining the Electoral College as a backup. Belenky suggests that the “winner-take-all” is the lesser evil compared to the proportional and the district (Maine-like) schemes of awarding state electoral votes and that its simple modification can make every state vote count, even under the Electoral College.    Alan Natapoff reaches for analogies from baseball and poker to describe voting systems, and ultimately relies on mathematics to shape his variation on the current EC system. Natapoff’s concept: Winner takes all by state, but rather than a fixed number of votes, states instead have the number of votes equal to the number of votes cast plus the proportional equivalent of the two electoral votes they have now. Winner takes all “magnifies the power of individual voters,” and works better than a simple national vote, unless the election is exquisitely close (with a margin less than 1 standard deviation). Concludes Natapoff: “We needn’t apologize for this system…it’s the ideal of a voting system…and it works.”"}

However, there is still no mechanistic description of either capacity limitations or top-down control of maintenance of information in working memory. Here, we propose that lateral inhibition in parietal cortex limits mnemonic capacity. However, at high loads, this inhibition can be counteracted by excitatory input from prefrontal cortex, thus boosting parietal capacity. We formulate this computationally in a biophysical cortical microcircuit model, and conceptualize it in a mathematical equation. Predictions from the model were confirmed in an fMRI study. The model provides a mechanistic framework for understanding top-down control of working memory, and specifies two different contributions of prefrontal and parietal cortex to working memory capacity."}

This is a much harder problem in principle, because it is inherently combinatorial on the number of parts (features) involved, both in the template object and in the scene. This talk describes a summary of our research efforts in setting this as a mathematical optimization problem and solving it efficiently by exploiting geometric constraints. The key insight involves encoding geometric constraints as conditional independency assumptions in a probabilistic graphical model. Due to some geometric facts, it is possible to show that such models are very well behaved: they allow for exact probabilistic inference in polynomial time. The result is a unified framework for structural visual pattern recognition that is able to handle in a principled way a variety of problems, including point pattern matching in its many instances: invariant to translations, isometries, scalings, affine or projective transformations. Attributed graph matching problems, such as matching road networks, can also be solved within such framework. Limitations and future directions will be discussed."}

The differences between the two types of convergence are illustrated with several examples. Some standard facts are also discussed: a uniform limit of continuous functions must be continuous; a uniform limit of bounded functions must be bounded; a uniform limit of unbounded functions must be unbounded.

There’s a broad consensus that Washington is apathetic toward engineering. While the NIH budget has grown from five to 30 billion dollars in the past 30 years, support for the physical sciences and engineering has been flat. Says Kristina Johnson, “Without the enabling technologies of quantitative approaches and analytical tools for the life sciences, you would not have the breakthroughs we’re having in medicine…This is a missed opportunity.”    The panelists don’t generally perceive the trend of offshoring as a threat. Jeffrey Nick suggests, “If we step up to it and embrace the fact that commoditization in all forms…is just a fact of life and the sky isn’t falling, we can go to a higher ground where there are new opportunities. Engineering is never a menial task.” Says Tom Magnanti, “Societies become more mobile. That doesn’t mean we have to lose the cutting edge or jobs here—there’s just a different flow to the people.”    But the panelists’ hackles go up over the lackluster U.S. performance in engineering education. China, says Johnson, graduates between 250 to 600 thousand engineers a year, versus 68 thousand in the U.S. Magnanti suggests, “We’ve got to work better at making science and math in K-12 accessible, more exciting.” Johnson notes, “Maybe mathematics is the broccoli of curriculum. We have to eat it at every meal. … We must require math every year. …Otherwise, we won’t have the students to sustain innovation.” And, she adds, role models are necessary to recruit more women and minorities into the discipline. At Xerox, says Sophie Vandebroek, “We have many women engineers—twice the national average….Our C.E.O. is a woman, an African-American woman is my boss. …We must find ways to change stereotypes.”    What can be done to help engineering as a profession regain its stature in this country? Magnanti suggests a broadened engineering degree program to teach both the fundamentals and “provide a sense of markets and innovation,” enabling graduates to take on more leadership positions. Nick recommends a focus on “teaching people how to be inventive and apply technologies from one field to another.”"}

Seth Lloyd discusses the Maxwell demon paradox and the spin-echo effect, and how in some cases, in an apparent violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics “entropy goes up and whoa, goes down then up.” He notes that when the laws of thermodynamics appear not to be true, “we simply revise our opinions and re-describe” them, which is “a pathetic situation.”    Owen Maroney invokes “straightforward statistical mechanical assumptions” in his discussion of whether “something can violate the Second Law or not,” and raises Szilard’s engine and Landauer’s erasure principle.    Silviu Guiasu aims to show there is no contradiction between microscopic reversibility of classical mechanics, as described by Hamilton’s equations of motion, and macroscopic irreversibility as described by the increase of entropy.    Ping Ao believes the dynamics behind Darwinian evolution “provide a natural framework” for thermodynamics, and it remains to translate “global statements to precise mathematical language.”    Jochen Gemmer discusses bubbles in Hilbert space, while examining how we might overcome the apparent contradiction between quantum dynamics and thermodynamics.    Bernard Guy focuses on the link between the Second Law and the problem of time, seeking clues for understanding the opposition of reversibility and irreversibility. He sees clashing constructs of time and space in the separate worlds of cognitivists and physicists.    Gian Paulo Berretta praises the seminal work and “pioneering intuition” of Keenan and Hatsopoulos, which inspires new answers to such fundamental issues as whether entropy is an intrinsic property of matter, and if irreversibility is an intrinsic feature of microscopic dynamics.    Speranta Gheorghiu-Svirschevski believes a nonlinear approach can help reconcile the Second Law and quantum evolution. In particular, she looks for ways to “reconcile locality and separability,” while acknowledging that general wisdom says it’s not exactly possible.    Dorion Sagan says that “ever since Darwin, life has been considered an exception to the Second Law.” On the contrary, “entropy, rather, energy spread, and evolution are inextricably linked.” Sagan suggests that “life may just be another energy spreading system,” and “death is the name we give the inevitable disruption of a specific part of life’s network.”"}

He unveils the real meaning behind words and things most of us use everyday without reflecting on what marvels they really represent.  Here are some of the mysteries exhibited, explored, and explained in this talk: How can you make two perfectly normal balloons zoom apart from each other? What happens when you connect a 12-volt light bulb to a 110-volt outlet? If you toss a handful of confetti onto a comb, why does some of it stick and some of it fly away? What’s the best way to make sure your flashlight will work the next time you really need it? (If you guessed putting in new batteries, go to the back of the class.)  Lewin is at his electrifying best when working with children from the audience. He gives a 12-year-old girl the worst hair day of her life, and offers a young boy 10 cents for 10 hours of backbreaking labor. But Lewin reaches a new high (low?) when he repeatedly beats one of his young assistants with a swatch of cat fur. Lewin doesn’t exempt himself from the torture, though: he even makes a serious attempt to electrocute himself with a 150,000-volt Van der Graaf generator.  Lewin indulges the armchair physicist who’s mathematically challenged, by covering all the basics of electricity and magnetism while introducing just one equation. If you’re still undecided, check out some of the unique special effects – sparks, flashes, smashes, and more –pinpointed in the Video Index. Keep watching, and you will find out why Walter Lewin was recently honored with MIT’s Everett Moore Baker Memorial Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching.

Mass action kinetic models are based on a number assumptions which are not obviously valid in the intracellular environment. The cytoplasm is far from an ideal, isotropic wellmixed solution and often the concentrations of important chemical species are very small. Molecular crowding can have significant thermodynamic effects, but also must play an important dynamical role. An interesting approach that has been adopted to this has its roots in fractal geometry - a given molecule, depending upon its size and shape and the sizes and shapes of the molecules which surround it will find itself able to move in an environment of restricted dimension (see for example[1, 2]). Simple ideas have been suggested which give spatially homogeneous rate-like equations which attempt to account for this. It has been suggested, for example, that rate laws which depend on non-integer powers of the concentration of species might be used, and alternatively that the rate constants for elementary reactions which involve the encounter of different species (as opposed to spontaneous decomposition of individual molecules) should be time-dependent[1]. In this case the rates decay in time - the suggested form is the Zipf-Mandlebrot law which tends to a power law decay at long times, it is suggested that this power law characterises the dimension of the restricted environment of each chemical species[2]. Both of these approaches suffer from shortcomings. The use of non-integer powers of concentrations can only be justified in very limited circumstances, and has been shown to be inferior to the time-dependent rate parameter when describing certain lattice gas computer simulations of chemical reactions. However, the latter is clearly not invariant to time translation - the origin of time has a particular significance, and it is not clear as a general principle what the correct choice of time origin should be. Moreover, experimental techniques are being refined to the extent that spatio-temporal resolution of the species within a single cell is becoming possible. We might, therefore, aspire to constructing theories which describe the dynamics for spatially non-uniform distributions of active species. We have recently been working on a class of simple models of this type. These are spatio-temporal dynamical systems which model reaction and diffusion on a certain class of fractal sets. It has been known for some time now that it is possible to define random walks, and hence diffusion, on a certain class of fractals (indeed, it was this observation that motivated the work described above[1]). A simple example if this class is the Sierpinsky Gasket which has constrictions to the diffusion process in the sense that it can be disconnected by the removal of a finite set of points. The talk will focus mainly on this example, but we shall also suggest ways which could lead to more general models.    Supported by the Manchester Institute for Mathematical Science (MIMS). "}

The distributed nature brings with it failing data sources and inconsistencies between autonomous knowledge bases. To reduce problems resulting from unavailable sources and to improve performance, caching can be used. Caches, however, raise new problems of imprecise or outdated information. We propose to distinguish between certain and cached information when reasoning on the semantic web, by extending the well known  $mathcal{FOUR}$  bilattice of truth and knowledge orders to  $mathcal{FOUR-C}$  , taking into account cached information. We discuss how users can be offered additional information about the reliability of inferred information, based on the availability of the corresponding information sources. We then extend the framework towards  $mathcal{FOUR-T}$  , allowing for multiple levels of trust on data sources. In this extended setting, knowledge about trust in information sources can be used to compute, how well an inferred statement can be trusted and to resolve inconsistencies arising from connecting multiple data sources. We redefine the stable model and well founded semantics on the basis of  $mathcal{FOUR-T}$ , and reformalize the Web Ontology Language OWL2 based on logical bilattices, to augment OWL knowledge bases with trust based reasoning.

Recently, much efforts have been made in developing inferential methods for such stochastic dynamical systems. Both state- and parameter estimation are of interests. The state-of-art Hybrid-Monte Carlo method has been applied to state estimation of non-linear diffusions. For parameter estimation, the data augmentation strategy is often adopted. Accordingly, state and parameters are sampled in a Gibbs-sampler setting. However, it has been reported that such a Monte-Carlo algorithm has very poor mixing property. This is due  to strong correlations between state and parameter samples. In this paper, we propose a maximal likelihood (ML) type II approach to parameter estimation. Equipped with the Wang-Landau algorithm from statistical physics, the novel algorithm is shown to be both accurate and efficient."}

The aim of the talk is to introduce the idea of deterministic chaos in an informal manner. Still, terms like dynamical system, determinism, nonlinearity, instability and sensitivity to initial conditions are introduced. Rather than giving mathematical description of the mentioned terms they are presented through experiment, double pendulum. This simple, yet instructive dynamical system can exhibit different kinds of dynamics, from periodic to chaotic. This way of presentation of chaotic behavior is oriented towards phenomenological and intuitive description of chaotic phenomena and hopefully will give another perspective to understanding of complexity."}

These international comparative studies under the auspices of IEA (International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement) were carried out for the first time in 1995. TIMSS is an abbreviation for Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, while ‘Advanced’ refers to the fact that the study relates to students selecting to specialize in Mathematics or Physics in the upper secondary school. TIMSS is a major source of information about level of achievement in Mathematics and Science. Decrease in Norwegian students’ achievement in Mathematics and Science has been measured since the mid 1990s, at all levels from primary, through lower secondary till the end of upper secondary school (Grønmo et al. 2010). The same is true for Sweden. Norway and Sweden have a lot in common in education, as organization of school, curriculum content in subjects, methods for instruction as well as how and when initiatives for changes took place. I will mainly present results of analyses based on Norwegian data, but we have done some of the same analyses based on Swedish data, and the conclusions seem to be the same for both countries (Grønmo and Gustafsson 2010). The problems I discuss here today are therefore most likely a Scandinavian issue, not only an issue for Norway. The Scandinavian countries have, for good reasons, been seen as a place to look for how to give the whole population a good education. Because of that, it may be even more important to be aware of some problematic issues related to education in these countries which it is not advisable to copy. ---- TIMSS in TIMSS Advanced sta mednarodni primerjalni raziskavi znanja matematike in naravoslovja pri u?encih po 4 in 8 letih šolanja in v zadnjem razredu višje srednje šole (višje sekundarno izobraževanje). Te mednarodne raziskave, ki potekajo pod okriljem organizacije IEA (Mednarodno združenje za vrednotenje izobraževalnih dosežkov – International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement), so prvi? izvedli leta 1995. Kratica TIMSS pomeni raziskavo trendov v znanju matematike in naravoslovja (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study), ‘Advanced’ pa pomeni, da gre za raziskave pri u?encih, ki so izbrali specializacijo iz matematike ali fizike v višji srednji šoli. TIMSS je glavni vir informacij o stopnji dosežkov pri matematiki in naravoslovju. Od sredine devetdesetih let 20. stoletja smo na vseh stopnjah izobraževanja, od osnovne do nižje in višje srednje šole pri norveških u?encih izmerili upad v znanju matematike in naravoslovja (Grønmo et al. 2010). Enako velja za Švedsko. Norveška in Švedska imata veliko skupnega v izobraževanju, šolskem sistemu, vsebini šolskih predmetov, metod pou?evanja in tudi v tem, kdaj so nastopile spremembe v šolskem sistemu in kakšne so bile. V glavnem bom prikazala rezultate analiz norveških podatkov, ?eprav smo podobne analize izdelali tudi na podlagi švedskih podatkov in zaklju?ki kažejo enako stanje v obeh državah (Grønmo in Gustafsson 2010). Problemi, o katerih razpravljam, so torej najverjetneje skandinavski problem in ne le norveški. Skandinavske države so, iz dobrih razlogov, tudi drugi jemali za vzgled, kako celotni populaciji zagotoviti dobro izobrazbo.

Our Classical karst has given the name for landscapes on carbonate rock and with its descriptions karstology has started to develop. 44% of Slovenija is karst and more than half of population is supplied with karst waters.     Good work in the Research program enables further development of exceptional international tradition of Slovene karstology. We co-operate with karstologists from the whole world and connect them also within the Academy for karst sciences. The Karst Research Institute at ZRC SAZU is one of the most important international research and study karstological centers.     We study karst in Slovenija and in numerous foreign countries, where we often help to develop karst researches. We are one of the strongest groups in developing a complex karstology, both in the contents and organization of karst research.       Internationally creatively we are developing the most important parts of karst research. Three-dimensional karst landscapes are researched in a complex manner including their surfaces, caves and waters. We deepen the knowledge of karst geology and the influences of carbonate rocks and tectonics on developing the karst features, of geomorphology and its connections with underground forms, and of genesis of caves in different rocks and conditions. A special attention is dedicated to the research of karst aquifers. We study them using water tracings and different models, which help us to plan the proper use and protection of karst waters. With biological and microbiological researches the base for understanding the karst ecology is prepared.    We are developing modern methodology of karst researches, from field research with long-term measurements of different parameters and laboratory analyses to modeling karst features on gypsum and mathematical computer modeling of karst processes and development of karst with specific circulation of water, which forms it.      Interdisciplinary upgrade of the research results enables us to recognize the development of karst in different conditions and the datations of karst features. The history of karstology is studied too.     We publish a scientific journal Acta carsologica listed in the international Science Citation Index and books in our series Carsologica, 25 in last 15 years.      We present fresh knowledge during our International karstological school, the largest international annual meeting of karstologists.     The complex knowledge about karst and its understanding is fundamental for successful planning of life on karst and for teaching about it. We take part at large projects on karst and its protection; in recent years especially for water supply, constructing traffic connections and use of karst phenomena for tourist purposes.     We establish the only graduate study of karstology, through which the students can obtain a doctorate in karstology. Our library is one of the most complete karstological libraries in the world. "}

I present a recent result showing that quasi-Newton methods can be interpreted as performing Gaussian (least-squares) regression on the Hessian of the objective function, using a particular noise process to keep uncertainty constant, and a non-obvious structured prior which ignores the duality between vectors and co-vectors. This insight connects these numerical methods to important areas of machine learning (regression) and control (Kalman filters). It allows cross-fertilization: Better numerical algorithms can be built using existing knowledge from machine learning, and machine learning can benefit from a new structured prior model allowing linear-cost inference on matrix-valued operators. Arguing for more and closer interaction between the fields of learning and numerical mathematics, I also point out some challenges arising from cultural differences between these communities."}

And if anyone has the right to some credibility in the prognostication arena, this overachieving inventor can. With crackling speed, Kurzweil powerpoints through charts illustrating the growth of various technologies over the centuries. His main points: technology evolves exponentially; the rate of technical progress itself is accelerating, so expect to “see 20,000 years of progress in the 21st century, about 1000 times greater than the 20th century.” Before you can say, “Hold your horses,” Kurzweil is off and running.    Say goodbye to cancer and heart disease within 15 years, and hello to living way past 80. And try to survive until the year 2029, which according to Kurzweil’s mathematical models, represents “25 turns of the screw in terms of doubling the power of information technology in every aspect of our lives.” We’ll see reverse engineering of the human brain, and computers that “will combine the subtlety and pattern recognition of human intelligence with the speed, memory and knowledge sharing of machine intelligence.” The marriage of nanotechnology and AI will bring us “a killer app”-- nanobots that can keep us healthy from the inside. These will also enable “full immersion virtual reality from within nervous systems” and expand human intelligence, facilitating “brain to brain communication. As for human conflict, Kurzweil sees an end to starvation and energy concerns, but doesn’t quite complete his utopia. New technologies may be used in anti-social ways, say, by a bioterrorist. “I’m less optimistic we can avoid all painful issues; we certainly did not do that in the 20th century,” concludes Kurzweil."}

While many validation measures have been developed for evaluating the performance of clustering algorithms, these measures often provide inconsistent information about the clustering performance and the best suitable measures to use in practice remain unknown. This paper thus fills this crucial void by giving an organized study of 16 external validation measures for K-means clustering. Specifically, we first introduce the importance of measure normalization in the evaluation of the clustering performance on data with imbalanced class distributions. We also provide normalization solutions for several measures. In addition, we summarize the major properties of these external measures. These properties can serve as the guidance for the selection of validation measures in different application scenarios. Finally, we reveal the interrelationships among these external measures. By mathematical transformation, we show that some validation measures are equivalent. Also, some measures have consistent validation performances. Most importantly, we provide a guide line to select the most suitable validation measures for K-means clustering."}

Evidence for General Relativity is offered from astronomical objects. The predicted presence and subsequent discovery of Neptune as proof of General Relativity are discussed, and stellar mass black holes are introduced.  **Reading assignment:**  Sheehan, William and Richard Baum. \\\"Neptune\u0027s Discovery.\\\" Astronomy (September 1996) : 43-49.

There are no pre-requisites for this module. In particular, there is no assumption that Mathematics has previously been studied to A-level standard. In common with practically all subjects, theory in Economics is intrinsically mathematical, and those areas of Mathematics - principally differential calculus and its applications - most relevant to Economics will be covered. The mathematical techniques will be illustrated through economic applications, principally microeconomic, in part because a microeconomics module is taken in parallel with this one.   It is important that you practice and try to understand the mathematical concepts presented to you within this module as they will be used throughout your undergraduate Economics degree. If you do not understand the mathematical concepts presented then seek help from the lecturer, the tutor or your QE1 tutor group.
